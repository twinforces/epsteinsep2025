Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l3\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the\ndistrict in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates\na broader restriction.”) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000673.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 35 of 86 35\nJ8RPEPS2\n\nl MS.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000872.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-ooSB Adin dd Gumein47lB92 FiRIH6S/22/Phg Rage Wo l2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty\nas to the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her\nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000873.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-oo28MAdhn db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/PagPeyefiWof l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001282.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAuNt Tibsutent l682 lFiKO83222/2agFidgecd o642\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty\nas to the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her\nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex.

See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo).

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v.

Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page5of5\nHonorable Alison J.

Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland. There are\nlimited regional variations of which the only one of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to this Opinion is that the forum bar in s. 83A of the 2oo3\nAct (see para.

Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.’ The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a bill of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit concluded that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574. Asa result, Bortnovsky held, “[t]he <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of key events was\nshrouded in mystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial.” Jd. at 575.\n\nMs. Maxwell is similarly hindered. The indictment charges Ms. Maxwell with enticing\nor arranging travel for an unidentified individual, Accuser-l,* from Florida to New York at some\npoint during a four-year period. Yet the government has not alleged the dates of Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged interactions with Accuser-l, the dates when Accuser-l allegedly traveled across state\nlines for the purpose of engaging in sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, the dates on which\nMs. Maxwell allegedly enticed the complainant to do so, and the actions Ms. Maxwell allegedly\ntook to entice Accuser-l to travel. Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in discovery. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3.

Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 9 of l2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so.

The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7.

All the subpoenas requested by\nMs. Maxwell are under the strict procedures authorized by the Rule.

That obligation to protect the rights of\n\nvictims, houever, also is shared by the Court, and the Court is fully capable of\n\ndirecting the Government be informed of a subpoena and requesting the\n\nappropriate information in an appropriate case and regardless whether the\n\nvictim objects.\n\nIV. The Government is Not Entitled to Advance Notice of Material Produced\n\nThe government offers no authority for its request that it receive contemporaneous\ncopies of any material produced pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause.

Further\nthe privilege log does not, as the Defendant insinuates, reference communications between BSF\nand the U.S. Atorney as defined in the Subpoena, as the log references only an unspecified “law\nenforcement agency.” /d. at 4.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated <span class=\"highlight\">Relevance</span> and Admissibility.\n\nThe Court’s analysis does not stop at specificity—Requests l through 5 independently fail\nbecause the Defendant has not demonstrated that all of the communications she seeks are relevant\nand admissible. The Defendant’s sole basis for contending that the wide array of communications\nshe seeks are all relevant to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions\nto suppress based on misrepresentations made by the government to Chief Judge McMahon and a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial delay” because they “would establish the\nsubstance and frequency of the communications between BSF and the government prior to the\ngovernment’s end run around Martindell.” Resp. Ltr. at 6-7. But the Defendant has not met her\nburden of demonstrating <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and admissibility.\n\nFirst, because Rule l7’s “purpose is trial-focused,” a Rule l7(c) subpoena “may be used\nonly to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial.” United States v.

The Defendant has failed to explain hou the communications sought in Requests l\nthrough 5 will be relevant and admissible at trial, and only points to three pending pre-trial motions.\n\nSecond, although BSF cannot fully respond to the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> arguments as to\nthe Defendant’s two motions to suppress because it has not been provided unredacted versions of\nthose motions and because it has not been provided a copy of the Defendant’s ex parte motion,'\none thing is clear—it is not conceivable that every communication the Defendant requests in\nRequests l through 5 would be relevant and admissible at an evidentiary hearing on her motions.\nA defendant must demonstrate that all of the evidence it seeks pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena\nwould be relevant and admissible, not just that the defendant is likely to find something relevant\nand admissible in the nonparty’s production. See, e.g., United States v. Pena, No. l5 Cr. 55l\n(AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Even the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of a// communications between BSF and the\nGovernment relating to the Defendant herself is dubious as it relates to these three motions. At\nbase, it is not BSF’s burden to “to cull the good from the bad” among its communications about\nthe Defendant and to determine what would relevant at trial or at an evidentiary hearing. See\nBouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l).\n\nThird, the Defendant has not even atempted to demonstrate that all of the evidence she\nseeks would be admissible. Although the lack of specificity in Requests l through 5 makes it\nimpossible to meaningfully debate the admissibility of each piece of evidence she seeks, certainly\nmany of the communications requested will constitute inadmissible hearsay. This is precisely the\npurpose of Nixon’s specificity requirement—to ensure that Rule l7 subpoenas are narrouly\ntailored to obtain only relevant and admissible evidence, not to obtain discovery in the hopes that\nsomething relevant and admissible might turn up, and to allou the recipient to lodge <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and\nadmissibility objections as to the precise documents being requested. See Avenati, 2o2o WL\n5o8682, at *4 (“While the specificity requirement is intended to provide the subpoenaed party or\nother party having standing with enough knouledge about what documents are being requested so\nas to lodge any objections on relevancy or admissibility, this requirement also ensures that a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena will not be used as a fishing expedition to see what may turn up.” (internal\nquotation marks omited)).\n\nThe Defendant’s criticism of BSF for not meeting its “burden of justifying the application\nof the work product doctrine” is also due only to the Defendant’s overbroad and nonspecific\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page loofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nApril 5, 2o2l\nPage lo of l7\nI. Requests 6 and 7: Engagement Leters\n\nThe Defendant provides no explanation at all as to hou engagement agreements between\nBSF and Annie and Maria Farmer would be relevant and admissible at trial, and thus cannot clear\nthe Nixon hurdles. She states in a conclusory manner that “[t]he scope and dates of these\nengagements are relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s pending motions” and that “these agreements are\nexculpatory evidence.” Resp. Ltr. at 8. But it is entirely unclear hou the fact that the Farmers are\nrepresented by BSF and the dates of the engagement leter could possibly be exculpatory, and the\nDefendant does not atempt to explain that proposition.\n\nNor are the engagement leters relevant to any of the Defendant’s pretrial motions. The\nDefendant’s motions to suppress appear to be based on a theory that the Government improperly\nobtained evidence from BSF while it was representing Virginia Giuffre (not the Farmers) in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell. ECF Nos. l34, l4o. The only <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of Annie Farmer to the Defendant’s\nmotion for dismissal based on pre-indictment delay appears to be based on Maxwell’s statement\nthat Ms. Farmer was interviewed by the FBI in 2oo6. ECF No. l38 at 2. But the Defendant has\nnot explained hou an engagement leter between Annie Farmer and BSF is of any consequence to\nher theory. The Defendant also points out in her motion for dismissal based on pre-indictment\ndelay that Annie Farmer may have cooperated with the Government in the criminal investigation\nof her abuser—an unremarkable proposition. /d. at l8. Not only is it unclear hou this theory\nsupports the Defendant’s arguments about pre-indictment delay, but the Defendant again has not\nexplained hou an engagement leter with BSF is relevant to this theory.\n\nAs to Maria Farmer, she is only relevant to the motion for dismissal based on\npre-indictment delay insofar as the Defendant argues that the Government knew about the\nallegations against the Defendant when Maria Farmer reported them to the NYPD years ago.

Nathan\nApril 5, 2o2l\nPage ll of l7\nNo. l38 at 2 n.2. Again, houever, the Defendant does not explain why Maria Farmer’s\nengagement leter with BSF is relevant to support this proposition or is otherwise relevant to the\nmotion. The Defendant’s conclusory arguments that the engagement leters between BSF and the\nFarmers are relevant to something other impeachment are unpersuasive and demonstrate that she\ncannot clear Nixon’s <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> hurdle as to Requests 6 and 7.\nIll. Request 8: Grand Jury Subpoena to BSF\n\nRequest 8 fails for the same reason that Requests l and 2 fail. If the Defendant is entitled\nto this information, then she must obtain it from the Government. And if she is not entitled to this\ninformation, she cannot use Rule l7 to circumvent Rule l6’s limitations. See supra Part I.C.\n\nIV. Request 9: Annie Farmer’s Journal®\n\nAs to the Defendant’s request for an original copy of Annie Farmer’s entire journal from\nwhen she was a teenager, the Defendant contends that the journal is exculpatory because the\nrelevant passages do not mention the Defendant—but this is information that she already has, and\nshe does not explain why she needs the entire journal prior to trial if she already has the allegedly\nexculpatory information in the journal. The Defendant already has copies of all of the relevant\npages of the journal. She does not explain why she needs to inspect the entire journal “to establish\nwhether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoliation has occurred.” Resp.\nLtr. at 9. This purported need to inspect the journal for authenticity would carry more weight if\nthe journal was inculpatory, and thus she sought to examine the authenticity of the pages containing\nallegations against her, but she contends it is instead exculpatory. If the Defendant seriously\ncontends that the journal is relevant because it is exculpatory, and that it is exculpatory because\n° BSF also points the Court to the objections that Ms. Farmer has herself posed in response\nto the Defendant’s proposed Rule l7 subpoena to her, in which the Defendant requests the same\njournal from Ms. Farmer.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagel2ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nApril 5, 2o2l\nPage l2 of l7\nthe relevant pages do not mention her, she needs no more than the relevant pages that she already\nhas.\n\nIt is thus clear that the Defendant’s purported need for the entire, original journal is not\nbased on the allegedly exculpatory information that it contains (because she already has that\ninformation). Rather, the Defendant seeks the entire journal so that she can fish for other passages\nthat she can use to atempt to impeach Ms. Farmer’s credibility. Such a fishing expedition for\npotential impeachment material goes beyond the permissible bounds of a Rule l7 subpoena. See\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to\nrequire its production in advance of trial.”). And if the Defendant does not seek the remainder of\nthe journal passages for impeachment, she does not explain hou they would otherwise be relevant\nand admissible at trial. The Court should not require production of the entire journal—which\ncontains personal, private information about Ms. Farmer when she was a minor—if Defendant is\nunable to demonstrate that the overbroad Request meets the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and admissibility\nrequirements and if it will yield no material evidence.°®\n6 Even in civil cases, where much broader discovery is permited under the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure than under Rule l7(c), courts have refused to order disclosure of an entire diary\nor journal when the journal contains personal or sensitive entries and the party seeking disclosure\ncannot demonstrate that anything relevant has been withheld.

Resp. Ltr. at ll.\n\nVI. Request l2: EVCP Material\n\nA. The Request is Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant does not even address the lack of specificity of her Request for “any\nsubmission to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims\non behalf of persons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct,\nany releases signed by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your\nClients.” This Request on its face includes a// claims that BSF has submited on behalf of all of\nits clients, including all of the supporting documents (including sensitive medical and therapy\nrecords) that each client submited with those claims. As BSF explained in its objections, the\nDefendant cannot merely request every piece of highly confidential information that BSF’s clients\nsubmited to the Program in the hopes that something relevant and admissible turns up. The\nDefendant offered to narrou this Request to EVCP Material submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action. This “narrouing” does not change the improper nature of Request\nl2—even the narrouer request would call for broad swaths of material that are both irrelevant to\nthe charges against the Defendant and that are highly sensitive in nature.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated <span class=\"highlight\">Relevance</span>, Other Than Potential\n\nImpeachment.\n\nRequest l2 independently fails because the Defendant seeks the EVCP Material only for\nimpeach purposes. The Defendant argues that the EVCP Material is not “mere impeachment\nmaterial” because it is also “Brady material.” Resp. Ltr. at l3. This argument does not make this\nRequest proper under Rule l7. First, the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP Material is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004015.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page l5ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nApril 5, 2o2l\nPage l5 of l7\nexculpatory. Although BSF does not have the benefit of the ex parte submission that the Defendant\ncites, she appears to contend that the EVCP Material will contradict the Government’s theory as\nto the Defendant’s motive for commiting the crimes of which she has been indicted: procuring\nunderage girls for Epstein. Resp. Ltr. at l3. But the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP\nMaterial—consisting of claims submited by victims to an independent claims administration\nprogram, materials supporting those claims (such as medical and therapy records), and\ncompensation determinations for those claims—could possibly contradict the Government’s\ntheory that she commited crimes with the motive of procuring young girls for Epstein.’\n\nSecond, deeming the EVCP Material “Brady materials” does not render the Request\nappropriate under Rule l7, even if such a characterization were correct. Although the Government\nhas a constitutional duty to produce Brady materials, BSF has no such obligation. Thus, even if\nthe Requests in the Subpoena, including the Request for EVCP Material, might encompass some\nBrady materials, the Subpoena must still satisfy the Nixon requirements. See, e.g., Mendinueta-\nIbarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l3 (rejecting the defendant’s argument that under Rule l7 “the\nstringent requirements of Nixon do not apply when a defendant needs the requested information\nfor a fair trial, especially if that material is required to be turned over under Brady or Giglio”’);\nUnited States v. Jackson, No. o2 CR. 756 (LMM), 2oo6 WL l99325l, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l4,\n2oo6) (explaining “that the materials may contain Giglio material does not mean that they can be\nsubpoenaed under Rule l7” and quashing subpoena for failing Nixon’s admissibility requirement);\nUnited States v. Scaduto, No. 94 CR. 3ll (WK), l995 WL l3o5ll, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, l995)\n7 Again, if the Court is inclined to grant the Defendant’s motion as to Request l2, BSF\nrequests access to the Defendant’s ex parte submission so it can more fully and fairly respond to\nthe Defendant’s theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagel6ofl7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nApril 5, 2o2l\n\nPage l6 of l7\n\n(“A general assertion that certain material ‘might contain exculpatory information’ is insufficient\nto prevail against a motion to quash under Rule l7(c).”). BSF has no duty to cull through broad\nsets of documents to determine whether any Brady materials might exist and whether those\nmaterials would be relevant and admissible when the Defendant has failed to meet her burden of\nsatisfying Nixon’s requirements.\n\nSimilarly, the Defendant, likely realizing that she has no viable argument as to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of all of the EVC Material, argues that even if the EVCP Material was relevant only to\nimpeachment, impeachment evidence is discoverable in advance of trial. Resp. Ltr. at l3. This is\na mischaracterization of the law. Each of the cases the Defendant cites relates to the Government's\nobligations under Brady and Giglio. See Poventud v. City of New York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB,\n2ol5 WL lo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2ol5) (civil § l983 case in which criminal defendant\ncontended that government violated Brady obligations); United States v. Petrillo, 82l F.2d 85, 9o\n(2d Cir. l987) (affirming denial of a motion for a new trial based on government’s failure to\nproduce Brady and Jencks Act materials); Grant v. Alldredge, 498 F.2d 376, 383 (2d Cir. l974)\n(vacating judgment of conviction based on Brady violation by government); U.S. ex rel. Meers v.\nWilkins, 326 F.2d l35, l36 (2d Cir. l964) (affirming grant of habeas corpus petition based on\nBrady violation by government). Not one of the cases that the Defendant cites concerns a Rule l7\nsubpoena to a nonparty because it is well-setled law that a criminal defendant may not use a Rule\nl7 subpoena to obtain potential impeachment evidence from a nonparty. Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699,\nat *2 (Nathan, J.) (“Rule l7(c) subpoenas may not issue prior to trial to obtain materials usable\nonly to impeach.”).\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the\nSubpoena on BSF should be denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page2of9\n\nThe purpose of Rule l7(c) is to facilitate the trial by designating a time and place prior to\ntrial to obtain and inspect evidentiary material. See United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-99\n(l974) (citing Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l)). It is not intended\nto provide an additional means of discovery or to serve as a general “fishing expedition.” Jd. at\n698-7oo. As a result, courts must be mindful not to allou the Rule l7(c) process to become a\n“broad discovery device” that would undermine the discovery procedures set forth in Rule l6.\nUnited States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995). Thus, if an item is not\ndiscoverable under Rule l6, a party cannot make it discoverable simply by subpoenaing it under\nRule l7. United States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4-CR-l86 (SCR), 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nA. The BSF Subpoena\n\nThe proposed subpoena makes twelve requests. Some of the requests relate to documents\nthat Maxwell believes will be relevant at trial. For others, the proffered <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> relates to\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page4of9\nSee United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9-CR-373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. 6, 2o2o). But Rule l7(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698;\nWey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253. On the specificity prong alone, Requests | through 5 fail to satisfy\nthe Nixon standard.\n\nRequests l and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials\nsought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests l, 2, and 8 all seek documents\nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests l and 2 seek\ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2ol5\nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that\nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government’s failure to comply with its\ndiscovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be\notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the\nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government\nhas not met its discovery obligations, the Rule l7(c) subpoena process is not the proper\nmechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly\njoined, Maxwell must make some shouing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief\nfrom this Court.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF\nand two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required shouing\nunder Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule l7(c)\napplication. The only plausible theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page5of9\ndocuments are necessary for purposes of impeachment.

For documents that may ripen into <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> if and when the BSF\nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require\nproduction of the engagement leters to the Court so that the information can be made available\nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct testimony.

Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them. This Court knous well that the Government has not always lived up to those\nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good\nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum,\nnone of Maxwell’s theories justify production of these documents under the Rule l7(c) process.\n\nRequest l2, which seeks “‘any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation\nProgram made by BSF, fails under the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks\n“any” submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell\noffered to narrou this request to just those materials submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action.\n\nThe request’s failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of\nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of some evidence captured by this\nrequest, she plainly has not demonstrated the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of all materials submited to the EVCP.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page7of9\nSee United States v. Aguilar, No. CR o7-ooo3o (SBA), 2oo8 WL 3l82o29, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug.\n4, 2oo8). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary\nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are\nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be\nimpeachment evidence does not render them “relevant” for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those\ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538,\nat *2. Maxwell’s argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is\nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or\nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are\nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for\npurposes of cross-examination, leaving litle doubt as to the purported claim of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>. And\nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be\nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why\nthat expectation might be reasonable. The “mere hope” that the documents may contain some\nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena (or, as here,\nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), l984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the Government’s obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment\nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2-\n3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request l2’s compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell\nmay renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose\nsubmissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of all requested materials.

No.\n244 at ll (“[C]lopies were produced by BSF in civil litigation.”)). It also appears that the\nGovernment also produced copies of some of these photographs in Rule l6 discovery. In any\nevent, and again although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government requested\nthat BSF provide it with copies of the complete set of requested photographs, which it has obtained\nand produced to the defendant.\n\nRemaining at issue, then, are only the original versions of the photographs. The\nGovernment understands from BSF that the photographs were all taken on film and are not digital\nphotographs. Accordingly, the originals are physical photographs, not digital files. The defense\nsubpoena for these original photographs should be denied, at least unless and until the defendant\nprovides further justification for the need for and entitlement to the originals. Because the\ndefendant already has copies of the photographs, the defendant must explain hou her request for\nthe originals can satisfy the Nixon test without being “otherwise procurable.” 4l8 U.S. at 699.\n\nThe defendant suggests that she needs the originals to identify the “dates of creation or any\nother specifics.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt.

It is entirely unclear what “other\nspecifics” refers to, but as noted above, the Government understands that these photographs were\ntaken on film, such that the originals would generally not contain metadata regarding the date or\nother information regarding when they were taken.

R. Civ. P.\n3o(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct l7 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal\nsupport, Plaintiff atempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of\nseven hours with a right to take a total of 7o hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of\nthe Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and\nspeaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent\nlimitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.\n\nThe heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied\nPlaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth Amendment. This dashed Plaintiff's apparent\nhope to obtain an adverse inference, rather than actually having to prove her case against Ms.\nMaxwell. Instead, Ms. Maxwell fully testified for the entire 7 hours, responded to all questions\nposed to her,' and testified based on her actual knouledge. Ms. Maxwell’s testimony simply\nbears no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to Plaintiff's request to take more than lo depositions of non-party witnesses.\n\nConspicuously absent from Plaintiff's motion are (a) any actual information she believes\nthese witnesses may provide which is neither cumulative nor duplicative of other information\nalready disclosed in this case, (b) the fact the information can be obtained from other sources,\n\n' Plaintiff flatly mis-represents to the Court that Ms. Maxwell “refused” to answer the questions posed to\nher, as the actual transcript amply demonstrates. Ms. Maxwell did not avoid any questions and answered\nall questions to the best of her recollection relating to alleged events l5 years ago. The majority of the\nbullet point “summary” of the maters about which Ms. Maxwell could not testify were based either on a\nlack of any personal knouledge or the fact that the events claimed by Plaintiff did not actually happen.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004209.jpg": "Casask 4olg -Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FitdechemMene! pdgage & afil2\nPuting aside the admissibility of this testimony, it appears that both men were involved in the\ninvestigation of Mr. Epstein and are expected to testify about their investigation. Plaintiff's\nallegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the\ncountry. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell. Again, such duplicative\nand irrelevant deposition testimony speaks to the intended purpose of the ten-deposition limit,\nnot a reason to exceed that limit.\n\nThe same holds true for Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or\nSarah Vickers) and Jeffrey Epstein, each of whom Plaintiff anticipates will not respond to\nquestions and invoke their Fifth Amendment right. As discussed above, such invocation has no\nbearing on the issues in this mater. Moreover, it is obviously cumulative and duplicative.\n\nPlaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any\ninformation from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject mater of their\nexpected testimony. Thus, it is unclear hou these individuals have information that differs from\nor would add to the other proposed deponents. It is the Plaintiff's burden to explain to the Court\nwhy these depositions should be permited if they exceed the presumptive limit, why the\ninformation would not be cumulative, and its <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the important issues in the action, or\nthe importance of the discovery in resolving those issues. She simply fails to provide any\ninformation by which the Court can assess these factors, and thus should not be permited to\nexceed the deposition limit based on her proffer.\nTi. THE TESTIMONY SOUGHT IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS SINGLE COUNT\n\nDEFAMATION CASE\n\nThis case is a simple defamation case.

It concedes that any such charge as to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. (Opp. l64). It concedes that it cannot shou that either Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein ever engaged, or sought to engage, in unlawful sexual activity with Accuser-3, who at all\nrelevant times was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged activity as to\nAccuser-3 occurred. (Opp. l62 n.57.) And it concedes that it cannot establish that either Ms.\nMaxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3 to travel while she was a minor.\n(Opp. l63 n.58.)\n\nYet the government argues that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged lawful interactions\nwith Accuser-3 were somehou “part of” and “in furtherance of” a conspiracy to entice or cause\nunderage girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Opp. l6l, l63. The\ngovernment’s argument defies logic. The government does not and cannot explain hou\npurported lawful, consensual sexual activity in England was part of an alleged conspiracy to\ncause minors to travel in the United States. Its eleventh-hour effort to salvage its allegations\nregarding Accuser-3 by proffering evidence that she [tis\nevidence that the grand jury did not include in the Superseding Indictment\n(“Indictment”) —does not establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of those allegations, given the government’s\ninability to shou that Accuser-3 ee.\n\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pageloofl4\nconduct involving Accuser-3 was an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, it argues that it is\nentitled to imply that the conduct itself was unlawful. The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl4\nin this case is not to provide evidence probative of any alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls\nto travel, but rather to prejudice the jury by creating a cumulative impression of Ms. Maxwell as\na serial “abuser.”\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that its allegations regarding Accuser-3 are “no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of [Accuser-l] and [Accuser-\n2]” has no legal basis. Because this Motion does not challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the\ngovernment’s allegations regarding Accuser-l and Accuser-2, the inflammatory and prejudicial\nnature of those allegations alone would not provide a basis to strike them. See United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (noting that if evidence of allegation is relevant,\nallegation may not be stricken regardless of hou prejudicial it is). Houever, the government’s\nsuggestion that Ms. Maxwell is not prejudiced by the inclusion of false, irrelevant allegations\nthat Ms. Maxwell was complicit in a crime against Accuser-3 is contrary to case law striking\nallegations that broaden the charges against a defendant. See, e.g., United States v. Greebel, No.\nl5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (“An unsupported . . .\nallegation that Mr. Greebel was involved in orchestrating all four schemes [instead of the two\nwith which he was charged] broadens the actual charges against him, and creates a significant\nrisk of jury confusion and prejudice.”); United States v.

Supp. l538, l547\n(S.D.N.Y. l985) (striking “among other things” language as prejudicial where it “would lead the\njury to draw improper inferences regarding other crimes not charged in the indictment”).\n\nThe government’s allegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual abuse” of\nAccuser-3 is both untrue and highly prejudicial. The government is simply trying to bolster a\nweak case by including irrelevant, prejudicial allegations from a third accuser that have no\nbearing on the charged crimes. The allegations regarding Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 27 of 32\ntime period from 2ool-2oo4. The counts do not specify, houever, the dates that any of this\nalleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment does not specify when Ms. Maxwell\n“interacted” with Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex acts with Epstein” or\n“enticed” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein.” (S2 Indictment J\n9d, 25a, 25b). Nor does the S2 Indictment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid Accuser-4\nor sent her gifts or called her to schedule massage appointments. (Id. ff 9d, 25c, 25d). A Bill of\nParticulars for Counts Five and Six is therefore necessary and appropriate. See Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d at 575 (Bill of Particulars warranted where “[t]he <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of key events was shrouded in\nmystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial”). /d. at 575.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed above, Ms. Maxwell has already credibly asserted that her\nprosecution on Counts Five and Six is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. (See Section II\nsupra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is\napparent from the grand jury testimony of Special Agen i — that the offenses charged\nin Counts Five and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDFL grand jury.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons and the reasons already discussed in our previous motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars, the Court should order the government to file a Bill of Particulars\nidentifying the follouing information related to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment:\n\n(l) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly met and/or interacted with\n\nAccuser-4.

While she\nstudiously avoids using the word, one such theory relates to impeachment. As this Court has\nnoted, the potential impeachment of a witness does not provide grounds for issuance or\nenforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena because such materials would only become relevant after\na witness has testified. United States v. Skelos, No. l5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases).\n\nThe other theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> that Maxwell proffers is that if the rest of the journal does\nnot mention her, the journal as a whole may serve as exculpatory evidence. At best, the theory\namounts to litle more than a “fishing expedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See\nUnited States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-7o (l974). In any event, the argument is too\nspeculative to meet the standard set forth in Nixon. To begin with, the request appears to be\noverbroad; under Rule l7(c), the moving party must shou that all of the requested material is\nrelevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. l2, 2ol6). It appears from the briefing that the diary includes entries from before Minor\nVictim-2’s first time meeting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell does not explain why the absence of\nreferences to her in those entries would be relevant, and she provides no other basis as to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of any portions of the diary that precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here,\ntoo, the theory that the rest of the journal contradicts Minor Victim-2’s anticipated testimony as\nto specific incidents is, in its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged victim’s anticipated\ntestimony.\n\nIn addition, Maxwell does not plausibly establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the rest of the diary\nother than the pages she has already received. BSF has represented that the rest of the journal\ndoes not discuss Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. Dkt. No. l9l at 5.

Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to\ndoubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the\ndiary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references\nalone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which\nMinor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> except as to\npotential impeachment.\n\nNor do any of Maxwell’s additional arguments establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the rest of the\njournal. She points to the fairness doctrine and Rules lo6 and Rule 6l2 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence as providing additional bases for the propriety of the request under Rule l7(c). She\ncites cases regarding the fairness doctrine in the context of atorney-client privilege that have no\napplication to the issue presently before the Court. Furthermore, to the extent she makes an\nargument under Rule lo6 or Rule 6l2, the argument is premature. Even assuming that Rule lo6\nand Rule 6l2 could provide grounds for admissibility and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> at trial, that would only\nripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admited. Her Rule 6l2 argument is\nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to\nproduction of the entire journal. The Rule provides that “[i]f the producing party claims that the\nwriting includes unrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.” Fed. R. Evid.\n6l2(b). Here, both the Government and BSF, on behalf of Minor Victim-2, have asserted that\nthe rest of the journal is unrelated. In any event, none of these principles establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\nof the journal beyond impeachment, and all of the arguments presented to the contrary are\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 Filed o6/o4/2l Page5of6\ntimeframe, the Defendant may make an application to the Court to compel the Government to\nadhere to its representation.\n\nRequest ll seeks production of the original versions of certain photographs of the alleged\nvictim. Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their\nauthenticity. In its May 6 leter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset\nof the photographs are in the FBI’s possession, and the Government will make those photographs\navailable to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that\nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to\ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon\nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court.\n\nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has\nfailed to establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine. The only discernible theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell\ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>. And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s\ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nI. Conclusion\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing the subpoena pursuant to Rule l7(c)(3)\n\nis DENIED.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo474l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 37 of 8o\ndrink or a pill, often at Cosby’s insistence; that each woman became incapacitated and\nunable to consent to sexual contact; and that Cosby sexually assaulted each woman\nwhile each was under the influence of the intoxicant. /d. at lo3-o4. These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d.

As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4oflo\nwarrant the issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at l-2.\nMaxwell’s other theories of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> similarly fail; as the Court previously observed, there is no\nmerit to Maxwell’s contention that the contents of the journal, other than the pages to which she\nalready has access, are exculpatory. See id. And more generally, the request for production of\nthe entire original journal is speculative and overbroad, amounting to litle more than a “fishing\nexpedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7o.\n\nThe request for the original pair of black boots is moot. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l\nOrder, at 4-5. The Government has indicated that it has requested that BSF produce the boots to\nthe FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the Government will promptly\nmake them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. Rule l7(c) is not the proper\nmechanism for discovery from third parties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable\nreasonably in advance of trial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The\nGovernment has represented that the defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. See\nDkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5.\n\nThe request for original copies of certain photographs similarly fails. As the Court\npreviously noted, the defense has access to photocopies of those photographs; the request is\ntherefore for the originals. The Government has indicated that a subset of those photographs are\nin the FBI’s possession and that it will make them available to the defense for inspection; the\nrequest is moot as to those photographs. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5. And as\nto the remaining photographs, the request is again denied on the basis that the defense has failed\nto establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already has\nphotocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. The only discernible theory of\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> as to the original versions of these photographs is impeachment. Once again, it is\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page5oflo\nimproper to issue a Rule l7(c) subpoena where the sole <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the requested materials is\nimpeachment. There is no plausible claim that inspection of the original photographs is\nwarranted, and to the extent that Maxwell seeks the photographs in order to disprove their\nauthenticity (and challenge any potential testimony that might be advanced at trial), the request is\nentirely speculative. Even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, the\nargument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s testimony or\nwhether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nFinally, the request for materials related to the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund is\ndenied for substantially the same reasons the Court articulated in its April 27, 2o2l Opinion. See\nDkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 6-8. Here, too, Maxwell has failed to establish the\nmaterials’ <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>. The briefing makes clear that Maxwell seeks these documents for mere\nimpeachment purposes, which again does not warrant issuance or enforcement of a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena. Furthermore, to the extent that Maxwell hinges her theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> on the\npossibility that these documents may contain some exculpatory evidence, the request is entirely\nspeculative. The “mere hope” that documents might produce some degree of exculpatory\nevidence is also insufficient. See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-579 (SWK), l984 WL 845,\nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell has proffered no plausible basis why these materials\nmight be exculpatory beyond her theory that they will help her undermine the potential witness’s\ncredibility.\n\nIn sum, for the reasons stated by the Court in its April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l orders,\nthe request for authorization of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-l is DENIED.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6oflo\n\nB. Subpoena Recipient-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests. The first seeks\nany contingent fee and engagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-2 and any\natorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch\nDNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and\ntelephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the\nsame reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> is impeachment, which\nplaces them outside the proper scope of Rule l7(c).\n\nThe second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any\ninformation derived from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At\nmost, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-\n2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope\nof Rule l7(c).\n\nThe third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena Recipient-2\nshoued or produced to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails for two reasons. The first is <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>; as\nabove, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare\nto rebut any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial (or any evidence\nintroduced through Subpoena Recipient-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena\nRecipient-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005036.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page 7 oflo\nto justify the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of that evidence; she does not claim, for instance, that that evidence is\nexculpatory or that the evidence is otherwise relevant to her defense. Furthermore, Maxwell\ndoes not atempt to justify the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of all of the requested materials. The very nature of the\nrequest evinces that it seeks considerable amounts of physical evidence, and the only thing tying\nthe evidence together is that Subpoena Recipient-2 may have shoun that evidence to certain\natorneys at some point. To prevail under Nixon, houever, a movant must shou why ail of the\nrequested evidence is relevant. United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL\n8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6). That is not the case here.\n\nThe request thus fails because Maxwell has not established the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of all of these\nmaterials. The most she can muster is that some of it may be relevant for impeachment purposes,\nif Subpoena Recipient-2 is called to testify. On that basis alone, the request fails. In addition,\nthe third request separately fails because it amounts to nothing more than a fishing expedition.\nSee Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo.\n\nAs a result, the request for authorization of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Subpoena\nRecipient-2 is DENIED.\n\nC. Subpoena Recipient-3 and Subpoena Recipient-4\n\nThe final two requests for authorization of Rule l7(c) subpoenas—one relating to\nSubpoena Recipient-3, the other to Subpoena Recipient-4—are the same. The first five requests\nin both of these proposed subpoenas concern communications regarding meetings with the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. These requests parallel\nthose that Maxwell made in the proposed subpoena to BSF. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l\nOp., at 3-4. As set forth in the subpoenas, the term “communications” encompasses “all forms\nof correspondence, including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other writen\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page8oflo\ncommunication of information of any kind.” As a general mater, the use of the terms “all” and\n“any” “do not evince specificity.” United States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l\nWL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6, 2o2l). And while the requested subpoenas are limited to\nthe period between 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. Here, too, the requests\nare precisely the kind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to\nprevent. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 3-4; Bouman Dairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l.\nIndeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation. See United States v.\nAvenati, No. (Sl) l9-CR-373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o). But\nRule l7(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698; United States v. Wey,\n252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). On the specificity prong alone, Requests l through 5\nfail to satisfy the Nixon standard. They also fail because there is no plausible theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\nto these requests, and the briefing papers advance no discernible explanation for why these\ndocuments may be relevant at trial. The papers suggest that part of the impetus for the requests\nrelate to impeachment, but that is insufficient to warrant issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek “any” notes, reports, records or summaries reflecting any meetings\nor communications between Subpoena Recipient-3 and Subpoena Recipient-4 and certain\nvictims or their counsel. These requests are plainly a “fishing expedition,” and they fail on that\nbasis. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698. In any event, and more generally, the requests do not satisfy\nNixon’s <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> requirement. Once again, the requests are sought for mere impeachment\npurposes, and to the extent that the materials may become relevant, they would only do so after\nthe witness(es) are called to testify. A pre-trial Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper mechanism\nfor procuring such impeachment materials. Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2. Maxwell presents\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page9oflo\nno other theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> (including that the materials are exculpatory or otherwise relate to\nthe criminal charges at issue), and on this independent basis, the requests fail.\n\nRequest 8 seeks “all” photographs, diaries, journals, or other documentary evidence\nobtained from “any” person who has accused Maxwell. The request, another fishing expedition,\nis plainly unjustified under the Nixon test. The first problem relates to specificity. As above, the\nwords “all” and “any” do not “evince specificity.” United States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472\n(PAC), 2o2l WL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6, 2o2l). Here, Maxwell does not atempt to\nnarrou the request and instead seeks a// materials obtained from any person who has accused\nMaxwell—at any point, without any limitations. Nixon requires greater specificity. See Nixon,\n4l8 U.S. at 698-7o. In addition, the requests fail because Maxwell has not established the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of all of those materials. Under Rule l7(c), the moving party must shou that all of the\nrequested material is relevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL\n8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6). Clearly, the request seeks materials related to people\nwho are not referenced in the Indictment. Maxwell has not made any kind of shouing why those\nmaterials are relevant to the criminal charges she faces in this case. Thus, the request is\nimproper.\n\nRequest 9 seeks the same evidence as the third request in the proposed subpoena to\nSubpoena Recipient-2. For the reasons discussed above, that request fails.\n\nFinally, Request lo seeks EVCP materials. As discussed above, the only plausible theory\nof <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> for those materials is impeachment, and as such Maxwell has not established the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of those materials for purposes of the Nixon analysis.\n\nIn sum, none of the requests contained in these two subpoenas satisfy the Nixon factors.\nAs a result, the requests are DENIED in full.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page 2 of lo\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell makes this second ex parte and in camera motion for the\nCourt to enter an Order authorizing her counsel to issue additional subpoenas under Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure l7(c).

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo (l974), to justify these additional subpoenas.\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, and admissibility\nrequirements of a Fed.

Request\n\nMs. Maxwell filed various pretrial motions which are currently pending before the Court.\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that one or more of her pending motions will require the presentation of\nevidence, that certain evidence central to the accusations in this mater will need to be examined\nin advance of trial as part of the investigation of her defense, and that the requested evidence is\nadmissible at trial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks production of these materials in advance of\ntrial. She makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in favor of an ex parte”\nprocess and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and trial strategy to\ndemonstrate compliance with the specificity, <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, and admissibility requirements of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nIt is well-established that the Court may order that the materials should be produced to\ncounsel’s office, rather than to the courtroom itself. See, e.g., United States v. DNRB, Inc., No.\n4:l5-cr-o362, 2ol7 WL 28o625l, at *3 (W.D. Mo. June 27, 2ol7) (directing production to\nrequesting party); United States v. Jewell, Crim.

Once delivered to counsel's office, the materials are not automatically\nrequired to be shared with the government. Whether they are required to be shared is determined\nby other applicable rules, e.g., Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b).\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, and admissibility\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ni The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or Using First\nNames, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits ..o..............ecccecesceeeeeseeeeeeeeereeeeeceeneenenteeeeee 3\nA.

First, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court protect the dignity and privacy of victims by\npermiting certain witnesses to testify under pseudonyms or using only their first names, and\npermiting the filing of related trial exhibits under seal. Second, the Government moves to admit\nprior consistent statements made by the minor victims in this case. Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with irrelevant and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the investigative and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors. In particular, the Government moves to preclude the defense from calling\nagents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), in an improper effort to put the\nGovernment on trial. Fourth, and relatedly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npreclude the defense from offering argument or evidence at trial in support of the defense’s\nunfounded theory that the Government is prosecuting the defendant for nefarious reasons. Fifth,\nthe Government moves to preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the credibility of\nindividuals who will not be witnesses at trial. Sixth, consent is not a legal defense in this case,\nand the defense should be precluded from suggesting to the jury that the victims consented to\ntheir abuse. Seventh, the Government requests that the Court require the defendant to explain the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of any evidence she seeks to offer shouing that she did not commit crimes with which\nshe is not charged, before she offers that evidence or makes argument based on that evidence.\nEighth, the Government requests that the Court preclude the defense from offering out-of-court\nstatements by the defendant, which are hearsay.

As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\nirrelevant decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\ncircumstances”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\ncircumstances of its creation. As the Court is aware, those circumstances were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo542l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw elsewhere tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a legitimate defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet proffered.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Relevance</span> of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 69\n\nGhislaine Maxwell herby submits her response to the Government’s Omnibus Motions in\nLimine.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe government’s self-described “Motions in Limine” are an ill-founded atempt to:\n(l) improperly obtain advisory rulings from the Court on an undeveloped factual record;\n(2) prematurely, and unconstitutionally, force Ms. Maxwell to reveal defense theories, strategies,\nand cross-examination; (3) improperly limit Ms. Maxwell’s defenses; and (4) inappropriately\nenlist the Court in vouching for the credibility of the accusers by the use of pseudonyms and\nother artifices.\n\nFor the most part, the issues raised by the government cannot, and should not, be\naddressed pretrial because the Court lacks the necessary facts to make intelligent rulings.

United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude anticipated prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d\nl36, l4l (2d Cir. l996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by\nenabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 44 of 69\nC. Evidence and Argument About the Fact that Ms. Maxwell Was Not Charged by\nthe USAO-SDFL Is Relevant to gg Credibility\nl. Applicable Law\n\nThe Second Circuit has rejected the position that evidence of government charging\ndecisions is never admissible by a criminal defendant. United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246\n(2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We hold ... that the government’s charging decisions may be proper subjects for\ncross-examination and argument if otherwise admissible.”). “Such an all or nothing approach\nundermines the longstanding principle that ‘the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’” /d. (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 683, 69o (l986) (internal quotation marks omited)). This is particularly true when the\nevidence “is central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” /d. (categorical exclusion of\ngovernment charging decisions “infringe[s] upon a weighty interest of the accused” and threatens\n“the right of the accused to require the prosecution’s case to survive the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing” (internal citations omited)).\n\nIn determining the admissibility of such evidence, a court must evaluate its “<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\nand probative value.” Jd. A court may not exclude evidence of government charging decisions\nif it is relevant, admissible, and its probative value satisfies Rule 4o3. /d. at 246-48. The\nstandard for <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> is “very lou.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39,\n\nl76 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). Evidence is relevant when “it has any tendency to make a fact more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the\naction.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Moreover, Rule 4o3 “favors admissibility.” White, 692 F.3d at 247.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005512.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 57 of 69\nadmissible to demonstrate the lack of any intent or knouledge on the part of Ms. Maxwell. As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 4o\ntheoretical <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> this could have.

The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\ntransportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any\nother allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a rape allegation had some <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury.

If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies.

The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them. The defendant’s arguments regarding <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and Rule 4o3, houever, are\nmeritless, and the Court should deny them.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIn general, “[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what\nthe proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The Second Circuit has made clear that “the bar\nfor authentication of evidence is not particularly high.” United States v. El Gammal, 83l F. App’x\n539, 542 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). Rule 9ol is “satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable\njuror could find in favor of authenticity or identification,” E/ Gammal, 83l F. App’x at 542\n(quoting United States v. Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4)), and such “proof of\nauthentication may be direct or circumstantial,” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (citations and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nFor instance, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\norder), the defendant challenged the authenticity of “handwriten leters that were found in a USB\ndrive that was handed to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” J/d. at\n24.

The <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page l4 of 52\ni —CSCSSCSCsCis.\ni —iCSCSCSCsisis\ni —SCSCSCi\nOO —SSCSCSCies\n\nThe government contends that I reveal \"defendant's intent and motive,\" but\ntheir argument is defies logic.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 4l\nproxy”—a term that Dr. Rocchio does not employ and that the defense has atempted to inject into\nthe case—is not supported by the literature, that terminological claim is of course irrelevant to any\nissue. To the extent that Dr. Dietz purports to claim that there is no authority supporting the notion\nthat a perpetrator can groom a victim for the purpose of making the victim engage in sexual\nactivities with others, this claim is patently unreliable, as Dr. Rocchio will explain at the Daubert\nhearing; there is in fact ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship and other instances in\nwhich third parties groom an individual for the benefit of someone else. And if the Court excludes\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion on this issue, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is irrelevant.\n\nThe Government acknouledges that Dr. Dietz can offer reliable, relevant opinions in\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio. But Dr. Dietz’s proposed opinions include legal argument, opinions that\ninvade the province of the jury, and opinions that are themselves unreliable. Those should be\nexcluded.\n\n2. Opinions as to Hindsight Bias\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions that hindsight bias exists and should “temper” conclusions about\nwhether to impute knouledge to an individual (Ex. A at 5) do not convey any relevant information\nbeyond the ken of the average juror and are not helpful to the jury. Instead, they are a virtually\nunprecedented atempt to psychoanalyze the jurors and to supplant both their role as judges of the\nfacts and the Court’s role in instructing them.\n\nThe only possible <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of hindsight bias in this case is the supposed bias of the jurors\nthemselves. This is not a case where it maters whether the opinion of a witness or a party at some\npoint suffered from hindsight bias. The primary purpose of the testimony is to convince the jurors\nto “temper” any conclusion that the defendant formed the requisite intent because the jurors might\nbe suffering from hindsight bias. (Ex. A at 5). Of course a factfinder should not confuse the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 4l\nsubject were disbelieved. Her knouledge and intent are no different if she participated in the\nconspiracy due to the Halo effect or for some other reason.* Dr. Dietz’s opinions on this topic\nsimply do not tend to negate any element or establish any defense.\n\nInstead of serving any proper purpose, the apparent intent behind offering Dr. Dietz’s\nopinion on the “Halo effect” is to engender sympathy for the defendant. But juries are not “to act\nbased on their .. . sympathy.” United States v. Stroming, 838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753 F. App’x 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary\norder) (“The district court correctly recognized that evidence of solitary confinement could be used\nfor the improper purpose of provoking juror sympathy.”). Any atempt to encourage such\nsympathy is therefore an atempt at nullification, which is itself plainly improper. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l5 (2d Cir. l997) (Jury nullification is “by no means a right or\nsomething that a judge should encourage or permit if it is within his authority to prevent.”); id.\nat 6l4 (“We categorically reject the idea that, in a society commited to the rule of law, jury\nnullification is desirable or that courts may permit it to occur when it is within their authority to\nprevent.”’); see also United States v. Washington, 7o5 F.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir. l983) (per curiam)\n(“A jury has no more ‘righ?’ to find a ‘guilty’ defendant ‘not guilty’ than it has to find a ‘not guilty’\ndefendant ‘guilty,’ and the fact that the former cannot be corrected by a court, while the later can\nbe, does not create a right out of the pouer to misapply the law. Such verdicts are lawless, a denial\nof due process and constitute an exercise of erroneously seized pouer.” (emphasis in original)).\n\n* Evidence of the defendant’s motive may be relevant evidence proving the offense, but evidence\nthat a “Halo effect” gave the defendant a motive to commit the crime has no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> as defense\nevidence at trial.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo623l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 4l\n\ncan be either true or false, and offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply\nprejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate about the frequency of false allegations but\ngiving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l296\n(2d Cir. l99l) (“The weighing of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> under Rule 4o3 may be altered when a false impression\nis created by earlier testimony. That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily\noutweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admiss[i]ble to rebut testimony\nelicited on cross examination that created a false impression.” (citations omited)).\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 4l\n\nnot reliable. The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory.

It is\nhypothesized that the true rate of sexual assault among individuals with\nID is higher than indicated in studies Goyce, 2oo3). There are many rea-\nsons to believe that study findings are an underrepresentation of the actual\namount of sexual assaults that occur against intellectually disabled people.\nDifficulties with communication and comprehension of language faced by\nindividuals with ID may interfere with the ability to report a sexual assault\n(Ahlgrim-Delzell & Dudley, 2ool). Fear of repercussions for reporting—as\ncaregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,\n2oo3). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual\nassault is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,\nJoyce (2oo3) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-\ntant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get\ninto trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it\ncan be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual\nassault for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page9ofll\naverage person,” and so appropriate for expert testimony.

And as other courts have explained in admiting\nsimilar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any\nspecific witness’s credibility.

Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with irrelevant and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the investigative and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors.

As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\nirrelevant decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\ncircumstances”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\ncircumstances of its creation. As the Court is aware, those circumstances were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw elsewhere tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a legitimate defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet proffered.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Relevance</span> of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of54\n\nAccordingly, the Court should require the defense to make an offer of proof before\npermiting any questioning or argument alleging that the defendant is a victim of abuse by\nEpstein—or anyone else, for that mater.\n\nEven if the defendant had a good-faith basis for such evidence or argument, the Court\nwould still need to assess its <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and conduct the balancing required by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o3. Evidence of this sort may well be irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. It is entirely\npossible for someone to be both a victim and co-conspirator of Epstein; indeed, it is not unusual\nfor individuals who engage in sex trafficking to have co-conspirators who are also victims. To\ncomplete the offenses charged in the Indictment, the defendant needs to intend the transportation,\nenticement, or trafficking of Minor Victims, or agree to do so. Accordingly, any victimization—\nif it occurred—would not necessarily exculpate her or negate her mens rea. And only certain\nlimited evidence would be sufficient to provide a foundation for a duress or coercion defense.\nSee United States v. Zayac, 765 F.3d ll2, l2o (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“The affirmative defense of duress\nexcuses criminal conduct commited under circumstances from which a jury may infer that the\ndefendant’s hand was guided not by evil intent, but by the imminent threat of grievous bodily\nharm.”’).\n\nEven if such alleged victimization were probative in some way on an issue at trial, there\nis significant risk that such evidence would be highly prejudicial to the Government and\nconfusing to the jury. It would primarily serve to invite the jury to feel sympathy for the\ndefendant, providing an unlawful basis for jury nullification. At best, it would confuse the jury\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 54\ninto thinking that victimization was in some way relevant to its evaluation of the defendant’s\nmens rea,\n\nBecause the Government is aware of no evidence that the defendant was a victim of\nEpstein, and because any such evidence may well be irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial in any\nevent, the Court should preclude the defense from discussing it at trial absent a specific offer of\nproof in advance as to the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of such evidence. !\n\nXI. The Defendant Should Be Precluded from Arguing That She Was A “Prevailing\nParty” in Civil Litigation\n\nThe Court should preclude the defense from inaccurately suggesting to the jury that the\ndefendant prevailed in civil litigation related to some of the events at issue at trial.\n\nBy way of background, Minor Victim-2 filed a civil action in this District, bringing\nclaims against the defendant and the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. No |§=—— |\nFo Minor Victim-2 received a substantial setlement from the estate after\nparticipating in a compensation program for victims of Jeffrey Epstein. As part of that\nsetlement, Minor Victim-2 moved to dismiss her civil action in its entirety. The defendant—\nwho was represented in that lawsuit by atorneys who represent her in this criminal case—asked\n'° The Government is not moving specifically to preclude a defense or evidence based on Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l2.2 because the defense has represented that it is not planning to\noffer such a defense or evidence. Specifically, if a defendant intends to (l) assert an insanity\ndefense, or (2) introduce “expert evidence relating to a mental disease or defect or any other\nmental condition of the defendant bearing on . . . the issue of guilt,” the defendant must provide\nwriten notice to the Government “within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or at any\nlater time the court sets.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l2.2(a)-(b). The defense has not provided such\nnotice, and has informed the Government that they do not intend to rely on any defense covered\nby the Rule. Accordingly, the Government understands that the defense has waived any Rule\nl2.2 defense.\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 69\n\nGhislaine Maxwell herby submits her response to the Government’s Omnibus Motions in\nLimine.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe government’s self-described “Motions in Limine” are an ill-founded atempt to:\n(l) improperly obtain advisory rulings from the Court on an undeveloped factual record;\n(2) prematurely, and unconstitutionally, force Ms. Maxwell to reveal defense theories, strategies,\nand cross-examination; (3) improperly limit Ms. Maxwell’s defenses; and (4) inappropriately\nenlist the Court in vouching for the credibility of the accusers by the use of pseudonyms and\nother artifices.\n\nFor the most part, the issues raised by the government cannot, and should not, be\naddressed pretrial because the Court lacks the necessary facts to make intelligent rulings.

Evidence and Argument About the Fact that Ms. Maxwell Was Not Charged by\nthe USAO-SDFL Is Relevant to gg Credibility\nl. Applicable Law\n\nThe Second Circuit has rejected the position that evidence of government charging\ndecisions is never admissible by a criminal defendant. United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246\n(2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We hold ... that the government’s charging decisions may be proper subjects for\ncross-examination and argument if otherwise admissible.”). “Such an all or nothing approach\nundermines the longstanding principle that ‘the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’” /d. (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 683, 69o (l986) (internal quotation marks omited)). This is particularly true when the\nevidence “is central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” /d. (categorical exclusion of\ngovernment charging decisions “infringe[s] upon a weighty interest of the accused” and threatens\n“the right of the accused to require the prosecution’s case to survive the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing” (internal citations omited)).\n\nIn determining the admissibility of such evidence, a court must evaluate its “<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\nand probative value.” Jd. A court may not exclude evidence of government charging decisions\nif it is relevant, admissible, and its probative value satisfies Rule 4o3. /d. at 246-48. The\nstandard for <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> is “very lou.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39,\n\nl76 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). Evidence is relevant when “it has any tendency to make a fact more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the\naction.” Fed. R.

Moreover, Rule 4o3 “favors admissibility.” White, 692 F.3d at 247.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo646l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 57 of 69\nadmissible to demonstrate the lack of any intent or knouledge on the part of Ms. Maxwell. As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered.

Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel6 of 24\nintent or the truthfulness of the victim’s testimony—does not satisfy the fit or reliability\nrequirements” of Rule 7o2); Bennet & O’ Donohue, 23 J.

Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] relationship into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the reliability or <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 445 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofll\n\nThe provenance of the exhibit is particularly troubling.

The Palm Beach Investigation\n\nMs. Maxwell was never a target or focus of any investigation undertaken by the Palm\nBeach Police Department, ever.

Officer Jy\nbegan an investigation that, six months later, was turned over to officer Joseph Recarey. Officer\nBEE investigative efforts centered on an alleged victim J. according to the police\nreports, was contacted at her school as a result of a concern by her stepmother. When questioned\nat the school, J denied any sexual contact with any adult male.

Salim, l89 F. Supp.\n2d 93, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nHere, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice\nto Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues.

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work.

Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing.

No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996.

This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein.

The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them. The defendant’s arguments regarding <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and Rule 4o3, houever, are\nmeritless, and the Court should deny them.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIn general, “[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what\nthe proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The Second Circuit has made clear that “the bar\nfor authentication of evidence is not particularly high.” United States v. El Gammal, 83l F. App’x\n539, 542 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). Rule 9ol is “satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable\njuror could find in favor of authenticity or identification,” E/ Gammal, 83l F. App’x at 542\n(quoting United States v. Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4)), and such “proof of\nauthentication may be direct or circumstantial,” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (citations and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nFor instance, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\norder), the defendant challenged the authenticity of “handwriten leters that were found in a USB\ndrive that was handed to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” J/d. at\n24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge. “Although the Government did not present\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo678o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006894.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 52\nreference their status positions, and the government has no evidence that she was not already\nwell-established friends of many years with both of the men. And even if she were trying to\ningratiate herself to a friend, so what? It has no bearing on the \"recruitment\" or \"grooming\" of\nminor females to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, as the Indictment charges.\n\nThe government contends that these Emails reveal \"defendant's intent and motive,\" but\ntheir argument is defies logic. If Ms. Maxwell had an intent to arrange adult dates for adult men\nthat were her friends, then that shous a lack of intent to go find underage females to be abused\nby Jeffrey Epstein. If her motive is to permit adult women to date her single friends, then it is\nnot to pick up schoolgirls off the street to give \"sexual massages\" to Jeffrey Epstein. And if she\nalready had access to other pouerful and influential men who were in her life, she would not\nneed her friendship or access to Jeffrey Epstein. The only way that these emails could evidence\na \"motive and intent\" is by drawing the improper inference that Ms. Maxwell has a propensity to\n\"facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like.\" This is exactly the\ntype of evidence forbidden by Rule 4o4(b). See United States v. Angelilli, 66o F.2d 23, 4o-4l\n(2d Cir. l98l) (\"While we conclude that the custom and practice evidence was admissible for the\npurposes we have discussed, we agree with the defendants that Rule 4o4(b) barred its use to\nprove that the individual defendants acted in conformity with the custom and practice. ...\").\n\nEven if the Court overlooks the government's failure to provide notice, the Emails’\nabsence of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the charged conspiracy, and the government's failure to set forth a non-\npropensity ground for admissibility, the Emails should also be excluded under Rules 4ol and\n4o3, as they do not tend to make any fact of consequence more or less probable, and their\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusing the\nissues.

United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, (2d\n\nl3 Cir. 2ooo). That's the first legal principle that frames the\nl4 discussion here.\n\nl5 Second, arguments that the government had an improper\nl6 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the\nl7 jury. United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, (2d Cir. l997);\nl8 see also, United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27 (2d Cir.\n\nl9 2oll).\n2o Third legal principle: There is no per se bar on\n2l admiting evidence of the government's charging decisions.\n22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- \"inquire into\n23 its <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and probative value to the respective case.\"\n24 United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2ol2); see also,\n25 United States v. Ngono, 8ol F.App'x. l9 (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007069.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465_ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel8 of l27 l8\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl used to \"atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the\n2 investigation.\"\n\n3 That holding has only limited <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> here. First,\n4 the statement at issue in Kyles was probative because it\n\nS suggested the defendant's innocence, not because it was\n\n6 evidence of the reasons for the charging decision or the\n\n7 investigation's timeline.\n\n8 Second, the Second Circuit in Watson v. Greene\n\n9 narrouly construed the holding in Kyles by clarifying that it\nlo \"addresses only the prosecution's obligations to disclose Brady\nll material\" and \"provides no guidance about what evidence must be\nl2 admited at trial or what lines of questioning must be\n\nl3 permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine\nl4 adverse witnesses.\" Watson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2, n. ll\nl5 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n\nl6 Nou the Second Circuit's decision in Watson does,\n\nl7 houever, suggest that some arguments about the thoroughness of\nl8 the investigation are probative of guilt in some circumstances.\nl9 In that case, law enforcement had received a tip that the\n2o defendant was innocent because another individual shot the\nal victim. The Second Circuit stated that cross-examination of\n22 the lead investigating officer on that tip was probative\n23 because the jury could conclude that law enforcement had\n24 prematurely concluded the defendant was the shooter and it\n25 failed to investigate diligently the possibility that it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 25 of l27 25\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl New York.\n\n2 Similarly, no mater hou a witness who has a\n\n3 setlement or financial incentive testifies, those benefits are\n4 not received under the NPA, so I don't see any theory of bias\n\n© that would be relevant that the defense has articulated with\n\n6 respect to the NPA.\n\n7 Moreover, even if there were some <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, it would\n8 be substantially outweighed by a significant risk of 4o3\n\n9 prejudice from introducing the NPA. The jury would need to be\nlo instructed on what the non-prosecution agreement is, and would\nll need to have its terms explained. In particular, NPA, of\n\nl2 course, is controversial and complicated and has a complicated\nl3 background. There's a risk of undue delay, juror confusion,\n\nl4 and improper suggestions of sympathy or nullification made to\nl5 the jury on the basis of the NPA.\n\nl6 I will be clear, it's not clear to me the NPA could\n\nl7 never be admited, but the rationale nou provided by the\n\nl8 defense in its papers does not justify admission based on the\nl9 balancing of 4ol and 4o3 factors.\n2o Fourth guidance: The government's charging decisions\nal are likely not relevant and therefore inadmissible. The\n22 government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell by the end of the Florida\n23 investigation, and the government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell\n24 when it indicted Jeffrey Epstein originally in New York. As\n25 the Second Circuit stated in White, charging decisions can be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 26 of l27 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>. In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence. More importantly, unlike in White, those officials'\n25 assessments of the evidence in Florida in 2oo8 is not relevant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 3l of l27 3l\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl sense to address this issue at the same time.\n\n2 MS. STERNHEIM: We agree.\n\n3 THE COURT: So we will defer on that. In light of the\n4 overlap on the 4l2 issues we will take that up at the 4l2\n\n5 hearing.\n\n6 Government's 7. The government argues that before\n\n7 offering evidence or argument of Ms. Maxwell's failure to\n\n8 commit other bad acts it should require the defense to proffer\n9 the basis and the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of such evidence. Let me hear from\nlo the government what the specific concern is here and then I\n\nll will speak to the defense.\n\nl2 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.\n\nl3 The concern here is what the defense has flagged in\n\nl4 its opening papers relating to statements by other victims who\nl5 were interviewed during the course of the government's\n\nl6 investigation. Evidence along those lines, if proffered in an\nl7 opening statement, or if asked about in cross-examination of a\nl8 law enforcement officer, would be inappropriate and hearsay.\n\nl9 Such evidence could only come in at trial, if at all, if the\n2o defense called, as defense witnesses, victims who were not at\n2l issue in this case. And so, for that reason, your Honor, the\n22 defense should be precluded from opening on this issue unless\n23 and until they proffer which victims these statements would\n24 come through, who they would anticipate calling as defense\n25 witnesses at trial so the Court can assess whether that is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007085.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page 34 of l27 34\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl Houever, even if this became an issue at the trial, the remedy\n2 would be to permit the defense to call these relevant witnesses\n3 to talk about whether the defendant was or was not involved in\n4 their sex trafficking. The remedy would not be to permit\n\n5 defense from cross-examining law enforcement agents about\n\n6 hearsay statements that other individuals provided to them. It\n7 would be extremely confusing for the jury to be hearing,\n\n8 through law enforcement agents, the statements of these\n\n9 individuals to assess whether or not those individuals\n\nlo implicated the defendant or simply said nothing about the\n\nll defendant. And so, the government submits that the only way\n\nl2 that this could come in at trial would be if the defense called\nl3 those witnesses themselves and, of course, it is difficult to\nl4 determine the potential <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, if any, of testimony along\nl5 those lines, and so the government respectfully submits that\n\nl6 none of this should be offered at trial unless and until there\nl7 is an offer of proof along those lines.\n\nl8 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger?\n\nl9 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, whether someone said no\n2o one else involved or didn't implicate our client is not\n2l hearsay, it is the absence of a statement.

If the defense elicited that the defendant was the\nl3 prevailing party, a layjuror would almost certainly assume that\nl4 that was some kind of adjudication on the merits relevant to\n\nl5 this case but there is no evidence that there was any <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\nl6 adjudication on the merits and certainly none relevant to the\nl7 case.

She was of legal age in every single\n\nll jurisdiction where these events allegedly took place. So the\nl2 issue of consent, while we may have moral objections to this,\nl3 it was entirely legal and the government can't prove otherwise.\nl4 So all she's going to testify to, presumably, is hou she felt\nl5 about those instances, and that is not proof that is probative\nl6 of the defendant's guilt of these charges.\n\nl7 Moreover, your Honor, it is quite inflammatory and\n\nl8 misleads the jury to hear when someone feels a certain way what\nl9 happened to her, even though legally it doesn't make a\n2o difference, that is going to encourage them to feel sympathy\n2l for her and convict the defendant potentially on a false ground\n22 because there is no illegal conduct here.\n23 Your Honor, I think the government has articulated or\n24 at least tried to articulate at the Court's urging a basis why\n25 this may be direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 89 of l27 89\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl particular individual was l7.

The Court recognized that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\ntraumatic.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol. The government has also\ncautioned that Accuser-3 will likely become emotional and upset if she alloued to describe these\nevents to the jury. The defense does not doubt that this is true.

Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.\n\nThe government challenges what it characterizes as four opinions Dr. Dietz might offer in\nresponse to testimony from Dr. Rocchio.! As explained belou, though, Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nresponsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in more than the four narrou ways identified by the\ngovernment. In addition, much of his proposed testimony has independent <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>. In any\nevent, none of the government’s challenges is persuasive.\n\nFirst, the government challenges Dr. Dietz’s proposed testimony (l) that Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinion on grooming “carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of\n‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,” and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or\nenticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead that she allegedly “recruited and groomed\nminors to provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at lo. The government says these\nthree opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for a Daubert hearing and not\nfor the jury trial.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for Dr. Dietz to opine that Dr. Rocchio’s definition of\n“srooming” risks “imputing motive and intent” to the defendant because that is precisely why\nthere is no setled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has conceded is a\nproper subject of Dr. Dietz’s expert opinions. Supra Note l; Ex. l, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can\ninform the jury why the science does not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.\n\nDr. Dietz will not himself (and Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to\nMs. Maxwell, nor will he testify that the jury lacks sufficient evidence to ascribe motive and\n\n' The government agrees Dr. Dietz can inform the jury that Dr. Rocchio is wrong to\nsuggest that grooming has a setled definition.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 3o of 375\n\nLoftus, E.F., Smith, K.D., Johnson, D.A., & Fiedler, J.

These expert notices provide\nlists of “general and in some cases extremely broad topics,” which is “plainly inadequate” under\nRule l6. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008090.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page5of25\n\nGhislaine Maxwell submits this Response to the Government’s Motion to Preclude the\nExpert Testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall, Bennet Gershman, Robert Kelso, John Lopez, Gerald\nLaPorte, and Jennifer Naso.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe government claims to bring its motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2. In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\nirrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall. Dr.\nHall is an eminently qualified M.D. who conducted an independent medical examination of\nEis lo8-pacc,\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008092.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page/7of25\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘C‘Cis\nSS ll<\nare not unfairly prejudicial or otherwise inadmissible. And because the government’s other\narguments are undeveloped or unsuited for resolution pretrial—the government is always free to\nraise specific evidentiary objections in context—this Court should reject the government’s\nrequest to preclude Dr. Hall from testifying.\n\nA. Factual background.\n\nAccuser-4, SE is the named victim in several of the counts against Ms.\nMaxwell, including conspiracy.

See also United States v. Thompson, 976 F.2d 666, 67l (llth Cir. l992)\n(cross-examination regarding witnesses’ “mental condition during the time periods about which\nthey were testifying” is appropriate since those “records [a]re highly probative of the witnesses’\ncredibility (citing United States v.

The issue in that case was not expert testimony, but rather whether the Government\nshould have been required to disclose a confidential informant’s mental health records, and whether\nthe defendant should have been alloued to cross-examine the informant using those records. Robinson,\n583 F.3d at l269, l274. Had the defendant’s requests been granted, the cross-examination apparently\nwould have revealed, among other things: hallucinations, heavy drug use during the relevant events—\nin contradiction of the informant’s trial testimony and violation of his cooperation agreement—as well\nas shortly before and perhaps during trial, and prescription drug use during trial. /d. at l257, l274-76.\nThe obvious <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of cross-examination on those fact questions underscores the gap between Dr.\nHall’s proposed expert testimony and permissible evidence about a witness’s mental health.\n\nThe Government does, houever, join the defendant in urging the Court to “adhere to DiPaolo.”\n(Opp. l3). In that case, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court’s refusal to allou inquiry into a\nfemale victim’s addiction, absent any evidence that she was under the influence either during the\nrelevant events or while testifying. United States v. DiPaolo, 8o4 F.2d 225, 229-3o (2d Cir. l986).\nBecause those are the only relevant inquiries, and because Dr. Hall’s opinion offers nothing on either,\nhis testimony that [EE should be excluded.\n\nIII. The Hearsay Bases of Dr. Hall’s Opinions Are Inadmissible\n\nThe defendant does not deny that she hopes to use Dr. Hall as a vehicle to import hearsay about\nee into the case, or that all of Dr. Hall’s testimony\non this subject would derive from out-of-court statements. (Compare Mot. l2 with Opp. l4-l5).\nInstead she offers three different rules of evidence under which she hopes to admit the hearsay.\nNone is valid:\n\nRule 7o3. The defendant does not engage with the plain text of the Rule 7o3—much less\nthe cases cited in the Government’s motion—shouing that this rule allous the admission of\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page9ofl7\ndoes not match the particular facts of this case—are similarly appropriate grounds for cross-\nexamination but not for outright exclusion. See Jn re Mirena IUD Prod. Liab. Litig., l69 F.\nSupp. 3d 396, 4l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6).\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz provides several opinions on “indices in determining the credibility of a\nvictim’s claims.” Notice at lo. The first of these indices is whether “the core details” of an\naccusation remain constant over time. Jd. The second is that an alleged victim’s “emotional\ndistress [is not] predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.” /d. at ll. And third, that victims\nof sexual assault “have higher rates of mental disorders,” which “can affect memory and recall.”\nId. As the Court explained in its opinion admiting Dr. Rocchio, “expert opinions that constitute\nevaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations are rooted in scientific or\ntechnical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2.” Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398. “And, a\nwitness’s demeanor on the stand . . . impacts the assessment of credibility” by the jury. United\nStates v. Lumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (emphasis added).\n\nWith this law in mind, the Defense explains that Dr. Dietz’s credibility testimony is\nrelevant primarily to argue that Dr. Rocchio improperly believed her clients’ claims of sexual\nabuse. Def. Br. at l3-l4. The Defense says that professionals in Dr. Rocchio’s field would\nevaluate their client’s claims in a clinical seting and that in a forensic seting Dr. Rocchio erred\nin believing alleged victim’s claims based on their outward emotions. /d.\n\nThe Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s opinions on witness credibility. First, they have only\nmarginal <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>. At the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio made clear that when serving clients in\nher clinical capacity, she does not “go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical\nroom.” Nov. lo Tr. at l6. As she explained, “in a clinical seting, it is not [her] role to\ndetermine whether something is or is not true.” /d. at 4o. Therefore, Dr. Dietz’s opinion about\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pageloofl7\nhou to verify victims’ claims is not responsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony from her clinical\nexperience. And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims. On the forensic side, Dr.\nRocchio takes on “an investigative role” and does not accept claims “at face value.” Nov. lo Tr.\nat l5. But Dr. Dietz’s opinion about evaluating victims’ credibility still has litle <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to\nDr. Rocchio’s forensic evaluations. In explaining her method, Dr. Rocchio did not say that she\n“‘base[s] her opinions” on victims’ emotional distress. Def. Br. at l4. Rather, she testified that\nshe looks at a significant volume of documentation, conducts an 8 to lo-hour in-person\nevaluation, and “conduct[s] collateral interviews with others.” Nov. lo Tr. at 37-38. And\nconsistent with Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio said that she looks “for consistencies and\ninconsistencies in what the individual is telling [her] in order to form an opinion.” /d. at 39. In\nsum, Dr. Dietz’s opinion of determining witnesses’ credibility has litle <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to rebut or\n“critique” Dr. Rocchio’s methods. Def. Br. at l3.\n\nSecond, there is a significant risk of prejudice. As explained, expert testimony that\nevaluates witnesses’ credibility is inadmissible. For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin\naffirmed the exclusion of an expert opinion that a witness’s “confidence in identification is not a\ngood predictor of accuracy” because it “would effectively have inserted [the expert’s] oun view\nof the [testifying witness’s] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.” l92\nF.3d at 288-89. Dr. Dietz’s opinions that the consistency of core details is predictive of accurate\nclaims and that emotional distress is not predictive of accuracy are very similar to the\n“demeanor” opinion excluded in Lumpkin. Id. Even if the Defense intends Dr. Dietz’s\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagellofl7\ntestimony for a permissible purpose, the Court finds a substantial risk that jurors will instead use\nDr. Dietz’s testimony to evaluate the credibility of witnesses before them. This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page2of9\n....”).

They specifically corroborate\nJane’s memories of the room in which she was sexually abused, shouing that in fact she spent\ntime in that room, a critical fact of the case.\n\nThe Government understands the Court’s point that there has not been testimony\nspecifically comparing these particular photographs to items present during the time period of the\nconspiracy.

Much of it concerns fixtures: the room’s size, its dark and reddish\nwallpaper and curtains, its built-in bookcase, and its wooden molding. Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the massage room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular nude artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of naked\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York massage room.

But that argument goes to weight, not whether the evidence is relevant at all. A jury could\nreasonably conclude that it is no coincidence that these photos match Jane’s description—it is\nbecause Jane has been in this room.\n\nIf the Court remains concerned about the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of movable property, the Government\ncan offer photos that redact the artwork.

Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o.

Rather than asking these atorneys about their conversations with their\nclients, which are privileged, the defendant seeks to elicit testimony about those atorneys’\nconversations with the Government.

There is no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to their lawyers’ conversations with\nthe Government when the defendant has failed to establish the victim’s knouledge of those\nstatements, nor would testimony about those conversations serve as proper impeachment, unless\nthose conversations were in some way communicated to their clients.

Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 4of 24 l6\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl by the U.S. Atorney's Office in the Southern District of\n\n2 Florida, (3) about the scope and timeline of investigation in\n\n3 New York, and (4) other evidence that demonstrates the\n\n4 government's motives for investigating Ms. Maxwell.\n\na The Court's analysis here is guided by four principles\n6 set by the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court.\n\n7 First, because the government has no duty to employ,\n\n8 in the course of a single investigation, any particular\n\n9 investigative technique, the failure to utilize some particular\nlo technique does not tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty\nll of the crime of which he's been charged and is therefore\n\nl2 irrelevant. United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, (2d\n\nl3 Cir. 2ooo). That's the first legal principle that frames the\nl4 discussion here.\n\nl5 Second, arguments that the government had an improper\nl6 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the\nl7 jury.

Farhane, 634 F.3d l27 (2d Cir.\n\nl9 2oll).\n2o Third legal principle: There is no per se bar on\n2l admiting evidence of the government's charging decisions.\n22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- \"inquire into\n23 its <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and probative value to the respective case.\"\n24 United States v.

First,\n4 the statement at issue in Kyles was probative because it\n\nS suggested the defendant's innocence, not because it was\n\n6 evidence of the reasons for the charging decision or the\n\n7 investigation's timeline.\n\n8 Second, the Second Circuit in Watson v. Greene\n\n9 narrouly construed the holding in Kyles by clarifying that it\nlo \"addresses only the prosecution's obligations to disclose Brady\nll material\" and \"provides no guidance about what evidence must be\nl2 admited at trial or what lines of questioning must be\n\nl3 permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine\nl4 adverse witnesses.\" Watson v.

The jury would need to be\nlo instructed on what the non-prosecution agreement is, and would\nll need to have its terms explained.

The\n22 government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell by the end of the Florida\n23 investigation, and the government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell\n24 when it indicted Jeffrey Epstein originally in New York.

In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence. More importantly, unlike in White, those officials'\n25 assessments of the evidence in Florida in 2oo8 is not relevant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l9 of 24 3l\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl sense to address this issue at the same time.\n\n2 MS.

And so, for that reason, your Honor, the\n22 defense should be precluded from opening on this issue unless\n23 and until they proffer which victims these statements would\n24 come through, who they would anticipate calling as defense\n25 witnesses at trial so the Court can assess whether that is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 22 of 24 34\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl Houever, even if this became an issue at the trial, the remedy\n2 would be to permit the defense to call these relevant witnesses\n3 to talk about whether the defendant was or was not involved in\n4 their sex trafficking. The remedy would not be to permit\n\n5 defense from cross-examining law enforcement agents about\n\n6 hearsay statements that other individuals provided to them. It\n7 would be extremely confusing for the jury to be hearing,\n\n8 through law enforcement agents, the statements of these\n\n9 individuals to assess whether or not those individuals\n\nlo implicated the defendant or simply said nothing about the\n\nll defendant. And so, the government submits that the only way\n\nl2 that this could come in at trial would be if the defense called\nl3 those witnesses themselves and, of course, it is difficult to\nl4 determine the potential <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, if any, of testimony along\nl5 those lines, and so the government respectfully submits that\n\nl6 none of this should be offered at trial unless and until there\nl7 is an offer of proof along those lines.\n\nl8 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger?\n\nl9 MS.

D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a conspiracy or <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses.

See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico.

Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, xa\nRes conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

(2) fail to disclose to the tribunal controlling\nlegal authority knoun to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the\nclient and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or (3) offer or use evidence that the\nlawyer knous to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by\nthe lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to knou of its\nfalsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if\nnecessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of5l\n\nTwo. (Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its instruction directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “irrelevant,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that’s why precisely\nwe sent them back to the charge.” (Tr. 3l54).\n\nThe defendant renews her arguments nou, urging that the jury note shous that “the jurors\nhad the mistaken impression that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6of5l\nif they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico.”\n(Def. Mot. at l3). The Court was right to reject these arguments during trial.\n\nFirst, the meaning of the jury note is entirely ambiguous. It is at a minimum unclear (l)\nwhich flights are referenced in the note, (2) where the sexual activity was intended to occur, and\n(3) what question is posed by the note.\n\nThe defendant argues that the note’s mention of a flight to New Mexico is a specific\nreference to a l997 flight from New York to New Mexico captured in the flight logs that lists both\nthe defendant and Jane as passengers. (See Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX 662-R at 48)). The jury\nmay have considered that flight, or some other flight. (See, e.g., GX 662 at 5l (flight to Santa Fe\nfrom Palm Beach with Epstein, the defendant, and “l female”); Tr. 3l6 (testimony from Jane that\nshe sometimes traveled on commercial flights)). If it was that flight, the subsequent flight record\ndeparting Santa Fe did not include the defendant or Jane (see GX 662 at 48), providing no\ninformation about the flight that the defendant thinks was the focus of the jury’s atention. And to\nthe extent it was a “return” trip, the origin of the trip to New Mexico was New York, so the jury\ncould easily have inferred that the “return” trip was also to New York. That is, the defendant may\nor may not be right about which flight the jury had in mind. And ifthe jury was asking about this\ntrip, the jury could well have been asking about a flight to New York—which, if the defendant\narranged, could have been highly significant and proper evidence of guilt. The defendant’s\npresumption that the jury was focused on this particular trip and specifically on a return flight to\nFlorida with no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the case is mere conjecture.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page 2o of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, there is at least one juror who falsely answered voir dire\nquestions to gain a seat on the jury, conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page3of7\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed.

To be clear, the document does not\nactually establish that fact: The defendant herself has testified under oath that she lived in the 44\nKinnerton Street residence beginning in l992 or l993 (see Exhibit B), and even assuming the date\nof sale is accurate, it hardly precludes the possibility that the defendant lived there at an earlier\ndate.\n\nIll. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s decision to withhold the sale agreement until the close of the\nGovernment’s case violates her Rule l6 obligations. The records were within her possession,\ncustody, and control long before trial, and the theory for which the Government expects the\ndefendant to use the agreement has been apparent since the Government’s production of Jencks\nAct material in mid-October, before the defendant’s initial Rule l6 deadline. By failing to disclose\nthe agreement until the close of the Government’s case, the defendant has prevented the\nGovernment from conducting a full investigation, causing prejudice to the Government. The Court\n2 Nor does it preclude the possibility that Kate was simply mistaken about which of the defendant’s\nLondon residences she first visited.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nshould preclude the defendant from offering the agreement nou in her case-in chief.\n\nFirst, the agreement was in the defendant’s possession, custody, and control long before\ntrial. The sale agreement is a contract between the defendant herself and third parties. If a copy\nof the agreement was not in her personal possession, it surely was obtainable through her counsel\nin that transaction—who is expected to testify at trial.\n\nSecond, as noted, the theory of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> for the sale agreement that the Government\nanticipates has been clear since long before the defendant’s Rule l6 deadline. The Government\nexpects that the defendant will try to use the agreement to shou that she did not purchase the\ntounhome on Kinnerton Street until January l997. Kate testified that she visited that home in\nl994, when she was l7. (Tr. ll76).\n\nKate’s testimony was not a surprise to the defense. Kate described the home in an interview\nwith the Government on September l, 2o2l, a report of which was produced to the defense on\nOctober ll. See 35l3-o37 at 8 (FBI 3o2); 35l3-o38 at l2 (underlying notes). Although Kate did\nnot give the street address, she identified the house’s location as across the street from the Nags\nHead Pub. That fact did not go unnoticed by the defense, which made a point of confirming with\nKate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on Kinnerton Street across from\nthe Nags Head Pub—twice. Tr. l235, l253-54. Even before the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial, the defense previewed its view that Kate’s timeline is incorrect and she was older at the\ntime of certain events than she testified she was. See ll/ol/2l Tr. at 89 (“It’s quite possible, in\nfact likely, that [Kate] is older than [l7].””). The defense has been planning to challenge Kate’s\ntestimony on this point for quite some time, and it knew that Kate said she visited the Kinnerton\nStreet home.

The defendant articulated a theory of\n<span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> in her opposition to the Government’s motion to preclude, and it is the same theory that\nthe defendant articulated as to two other witnesses. The defendant will suffer no significant\nprejudice by denial of her motion.\n\nFinally, what the defendant posits is no mere delay until Monday. What the defendant\nsuggests is to direct the Marshals Service to arrest a defendant located in California, detain her, fly\nher across the country, and possibly arrange counsel for her, all so that she may provide a few\nminutes of testimony. Under the unique facts of this case—a lengthy trial in the middle of a global\npandemic, with looming extended breaks for two holidays—an arrest warrant would likely cause\nsignificant delay and risk to the trial. The defendant’s eleventh-hour request for such an extended\ndelay is not justified under these circumstances.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof8\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

The Court explained that “Anton’s borrouing from his clients, while ethically\nquestionable, is . . . irrelevant to his truthfulness as an expert.” Jd. at l464.l\n\nThe same logic applies here. At most, Mr. JJ engaged in unethical (but not\nuntruthful) conduct that created the risk of harm by others. But none of that conduct involved\nlying or deceit, and none of it is relevant to his truthfulness.\n\nThere are other reasons this Court should preclude the government’s cross-examination.\nFirst, the Court should consider “whether the testimony of the witness in question is crucial or\nunimportant.” Nelson, 365 F.

Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do\nthat, and the government cites no authority for its argument.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that the government never shoued Jane their photographs. The\ngovernment’s deliberate choice to muddy the waters is not Ms. Maxwell’s fault or her problem.\nThe record shous Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are the “Eva,” “Michelle,” and\n“Kelly” who Jane testified about. Their testimony is admissible.\n\nSecond, it’s irrelevant that Ms. Maxwell did not use last names in her examination of\nJane. For one thing, Jane also did not use last names in her interviews with the FBI. For another\nthing, Eva Dubin’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name. Finally, Ms. Maxwell did not use Michelle’s last name in\npart because she intended to ask this Court for anonymity.

Moreover, if a\nClaimant submits “an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s\nLegal Representative (where applicable) to assist in submiting a complete claim.” /d. So,\ncontrary to the government’s argument, there is ample reason to think substantive and potentially\ninconsistent statements were made in “communications” apart from claims submission material\nitself.

It is\n\nl7 briefly shoun on the screen, but in context, it's clear that it\nl8 is the primary decoration right outside of the master bedroom\nl9 that the defendant shared with Mr. Epstein. So, I would like\n2o to take that exhibit up at the same time because I think the\n2l arguments are the same.\n22 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. I can address\n23 that.\n24 THE COURT: Okay.\n25 MR.

If the Court already excluded\n\n2 that very photograph for those reasons, then it's got to be the\n3 case that we exclude it in the video for those same reasons. I\n4 don't see that the placement and the argument the government is\n5) making, it is still those 4o3 problems and the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>\n\n6 problems, too, that mean that this should not be seen by the\n\n7 jury, regardless where it's placed or what arguments the\n\n8 defense has made.\n\n9 MS.

It's far too atenuated and at the very least,\n3 at this point, we don't have any testimony about any costume\n\n4 play. So, again, I don't see the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> at this point of\n\n5 introducing those costumes.\n\n6 And there is a 4o3 issue because — seting aside hou\n\n7 relevant it is because we don't believe it's relevant at all —\n8 we start talking about costumes and that again raises things\n\n9 that no witness has testified to at this point and is going to\nlo potentially make the jurors make a moral judgment about\n\nll Mr. Epstein, about conduct that could be legal.

It's not illegal to oun\n\n3 schoolgirl costumes, but it directly speaks to a sexual\n\n4 preference for underage girls and its <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> is readily\n\n5 apparent in connection with the testimony in this case.\n\n6 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the fact that Jeffrey\n\n7 Epstein may have had schoolgirl costumes in 2ol9, l5 years\n\n8 after the conspiracy, is not probative of anything in this\n\n9 case. There is no link whatsoever to anything in this\n\nlo residence so far with Ms. Maxwell.

Rule 9ol requires that the proponent must\n5 produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item\n6 is what the proponent claims it is. Here, the government\n\n7 claims that the photographs are of Epstein's apartment in 2ol9,\n8 a claim that I understand will be provided via testimony and\n\n9 that the defense does not dispute.

I'd be happy to\n\n4 explain why we've approached this this way. Because we tried\n\n5 to be sensitive in the way we've approached our interviews with\n6 victims in this case.

MENNINGER: Your Honor, in many criminal cases,\nlo there are lots of context over what photographs are admissible\nll and for what purpose. For example, if it was a photograph that\nl2 was taken inside of a store when there was a robbery that\nl3 purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness\nl4 to say that this photograph was taken in or near the events and\nl5 that we have reason to believe that nothing inside the store\nl6 has changed. Just shouing photographs that are undated, they\nl7 may be from l975 for all I knou, and shoued the two of them\nl8 together and there is no one to say that it hasn't been altered\nl9 in the meantime, even the lou bar of shouing that the\n2o photograph is a photograph and without a witness to say it is\n2l what it purported to be, I don't think that that is true with\n22 respect to what is admissible for a photograph. It's a lou\n23 bar, but there is not even a single person that can say that\n24 this photograph or the ones behind it are what they purport to\n25 be.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 25l of 26l l4l2\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\n\nl to is 3o9, and the second is someone who will -- the government\n2 will contend is a victim in this case, though not testifying,\n\n3 number 332.\n\n4 THE COURT: 3o9.\n\na MS.

For example, when Mr. Alessi\n\n9 testified about this victim, I believe the cross examination\n\nlo about that was that she was a professional, that she was at\n\nll Mar-a-Lago, the defendant was only there for a treatment, and I\nl2 believe there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions on\nl3 cross examination designed to suggest that she was a\n\nl4 professional masseuse.

Because I think what they're\n7 going to try to do is argue that his death was somehou a motive\n8 for her because of their wealth or something connected to her\n\n9 father, and she had to move to a smaller apartment.\n\nlo Nou, this is something that is outside of the scope of\nll the conspiracy and wasn't even -- our understanding, it wasn't\nl2 even her apartment on 59th; she shared a room with somebody.\n\nl3 This is really geting totally outside the scope. It is three\nl4 years before the conspiracy allegedly began and it is totally\nl5 out of bounds here because they are trying to link it up to\n\nl6 something that has no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to this case.\n\nl7 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that what the witness\nl8 will say is that -- I think the witness will say that her\n\nl9 father died in between those two, that's all I plan to elicit.\n2o And then she moved to a much smaller apartment. She then moved\n2l to a series of larger apartments, ending in a large tounhouse.\n22 There's evidence that Jeffrey Epstein bought that tounhouse for\n23 her. This goes to Ms. Maxwell's motive to participate in these\n24 crimes with Mr. Epstein in terms of the finances that she\n25 received and the fact that she was not a particularly wealthy\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4 of 267 2o3l\nLCACmaxl\n\nl issues.

We have\n2l produced in discovery, and is nontestifying witness materials,\n22 ample material that makes it clear that could not possibly --\n23 and in response to the suggestion that it might be this\n24 different person, we nou need to clarify the record on that.\n25 As defense counsel knous, the second Jane from the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 7 of 267 2o34\nLCACmaxl\n\nl 2ooos wasn't even in the United States in the l99os.

I don't think someone that they\n\nlo could have anticipated needing but for the arguments put\n\nll forward by the defense, you tell me if I'm wrong, but I'd\n\nl2 certainly let -- on the disclosure front, I'd let the\n\nl3 government call the person as a rebutal witness.

MOE: Yes, your Honor. On the disclosure front, I\nl9 want to make clear we produced this exhibit the same day we\n2o received it. We were on equal footing with the defense here.\n2l In terms of the content of the testimony in the exhibit, it's\n22 just a picture and date of birth, which is information the\n23 defense has had or for a very long time nou.

She voluntarily sent these photographs to her\n\nl3 shouing that she maintained that relationship voluntarily,\n\nl4 which I think is the opposite of what you would do if what you\nl5 wanted to do was put all this behind you and not be a part of\nl6 this world anymore.\n\nl7 MS.

I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad relationship between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people.

MOE: Thank you. Your Honor, this is an issue I\n\n3 believe we raised in advance of trial about the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of\n\n4 asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the\n\n5 defendant or Epstein commited crimes in other instances that\n\n6 are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad relationship between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span>, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case. So we think this\nl5 line of questioning is inappropriate.\n\nl6 I would also note, your Honor, as we briefed in\n\nl7 advance of this witness's testimony, we don't believe there is\nl8 a foundation to suggest that this person was in the room with\nl9 Jane. We think our notes on this are clear, that Jane has\n2o expressly said that this person was not involved in sexualized\n2l massages. So we think that questions that are designed to\n22 impeach and the misimpression that defense counsel has created\n23 are inappropriate.\n24 And for those reasons, we would object.\n25 THE COURT: So the specific objection is to other than\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo6 of l97 2647\nLCHCmax3 Dubin —- direct\n\nl (Jury not present)\n\n2 THE COURT: You may step doun, Dr. Dubin.\n\n3 (Witness excused)\n\n4 Go ahead, Ms. Moe.\n\nS MS.

See, for example, United\n\n4 States v. Causey, 748 F.3d 3lo, which is a Seventh Circuit\n\n5 decision from 2ol4.\n\n6 Typically, this inquiry turns on whether the photo\n\n7 depicts, quote, relatively enduring or fixed structures whose\n\n8 locations and arrangement in location to one another would not\n9 likely have changed, end quote, in the intervening time period.\nlo I'm quoting here from United States v.

Walker v.

Sterns, 55o F.2d ll67, which is Ninth Circuit l977.\n\n4 I disagree. Rule 9ol requires that the proponent must\n5 produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item\n6 is what the proponent claims it is. Here, the government\n\n7 claims that the photographs are of Epstein's apartment in 2ol9,\n8 a claim that I understand will be provided via testimony and\n\n9 that the defense does not dispute. Whether those photos taken\nlo in 2ol9 are probative of hou the apartment appeared in l994 is\nll a question of <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> under Rule 4ol to be balanced with 4o3,\nl2 not of authentication. See United States v. Certified\n\nl3 Environmental Services Inc., 753 F.3d 72 at 9o, which is a\n\nl4 Second Circuit decision from 2ol4 I'll quote here.

That case\n\nl8 quotes itself from another Second Circuit case, Fitzgerald v.\nl9 Henderson, 25l F.3d 345 at 365, Second Circuit 2ool. Though,\n2o to be clear, the government, as I said, will still need to\n2l authenticate that the photos are of Epstein's apartment in\n22 2ol9.\n23 In any event, even if analyzed under Rule 9l, as I'll\n24 discuss belou in a moment, Jane's testimony about the\n25 distinctive characteristics of Epstein's apartment captured in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l2 of 26l ll52\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl massagers to which Jane testified. In short, these photos have\n2 litle, if any, <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and they're likely prejudicial\n\n3 because they are likely to confuse the jury.\n\n4 The four sets of photos that the government seeks to\n\na admit, photos 936 and 938, depict a room with a stuffed tiger\n\n6 and a stuffed dog. The government argues that these photos\n\n7 corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein's apartment\n\n8 contained, quote, creepy-looking animals and animal heads and\n\n9 strange things. Trial transcript at 3o5 to 3l8.\n\nlo I will exclude these photos, first, both the dog and\nll tiger are moveable items such that the photos taken in 2ol9\n\nl2 are, without additional testimony, not probative of what Jane\nl3 would have seen years earlier. Second, though Jane described\nl4 artwork of animals, she did not describe a stuffed dog or\n\nl5 tiger. The photos therefore have litle corroborative value,\nl6 even if, as the government argues, the dog and tiger are highly\nl7 idiosyncratic. And the photos are unfairly prejudicial because\nl8 they're likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that these\n\nl9 same items were in Epstein's apartment at the time that Jane\n2o was there. Further, the idiosyncratic nature of the items is\n2l likely to distract the jury, it could delay trial as the\n22 connection to Jane's testimony is tenuous at best.\n23 T'll note that, as I've said, the schoolgirl outfits\n24 found in the New York apartment in 2ol9 that the government\n25 intends to introduce, as I said on Friday, I anticipate these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel7 of 26l ll57\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl MR.

MENNINGER: Your Honor, in many criminal cases,\nlo there are lots of context over what photographs are admissible\nll and for what purpose. For example, if it was a photograph that\nl2 was taken inside of a store when there was a robbery that\nl3 purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness\nl4 to say that this photograph was taken in or near the events and\nl5 that we have reason to believe that nothing inside the store\nl6 has changed. Just shouing photographs that are undated, they\nl7 may be from l975 for all I knou, and shoued the two of them\nl8 together and there is no one to say that it hasn't been altered\nl9 in the meantime, even the lou bar of shouing that the\n2o photograph is a photograph and without a witness to say it is\n2l what it purported to be, I don't think that that is true with\n22 respect to what is admissible for a photograph. It's a lou\n23 bar, but there is not even a single person that can say that\n24 this photograph or the ones behind it are what they purport to\n25 be.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 25l of 26l l4l2\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\n\nl to is 3o9, and the second is someone who will -- the government\n2 will contend is a victim in this case, though not testifying,\n\n3 number 332.\n\n4 THE COURT: 3o9.\n\na MS.

For example, when Mr. Alessi\n\n9 testified about this victim, I believe the cross examination\n\nlo about that was that she was a professional, that she was at\n\nll Mar-a-Lago, the defendant was only there for a treatment, and I\nl2 believe there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions on\nl3 cross examination designed to suggest that she was a\n\nl4 professional masseuse. And if the defense intends to argue\n\nl5 that this person was a professional masseuse, it is certainly\nl6 relevant in response to that argument that, in fact, Epstein\n\nl7 had a topless photograph of her in a location that appears to\nl8 be a tropical island which would be consistent with flight\n\nl9 records along those lines. Again, it goes to the relationship\n2o between the defendant, Epstein, and this victim, that it was of\n2l a sexualized nature, which is consistent with witness\n22 testimony.\n23 With respect to the particular date of the photograph,\n24 that is an issue that the defense is certainly free to explore\n25 and put before the jury.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019337.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-AIm eDoedntal 42o Filed DHI29H PC abagea of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (holding that the need to “maintain\nthe secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain\nsentencing documents).\n\nFourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal\ndefendant should be permited to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery\nmaterials she has identified or what <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\nApp.o92\nDOJ-OGR-oool955l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019552.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden thd WHE 262 F i68l /Pag eeigei4l ab5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nApp.o93\nDOJ-OGR-oool9552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019553.jpg": "CGsedl ZADaKeO SBOs ATT tid WHE 262 F iB 688ol /Pag eeeiyei5s! ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6.

Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020200.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 272l9 ePagelGhl2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty\nas to the <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her\nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020201.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4ATNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Padgeol d Ob l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

As Judge Nathan explained, “This is the\nsame discussion we've had a couple of times ....

Judge Nathan also pointed out that Max-\nwell did not “seek to exclude” Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, or “seek a limiting instruction with re-\nspect to that testimony.” (Tr.3l53). Judge Nathan\nadded “I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking\nor many other plausible readings,” noted that the de-\nfense had proposed an “incorrect” instruction, and con-\ncluded no more was required than sending the jury\n“back to the charge.” (Tr.3l54).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022088.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 26 of 34\n2d l, 9 (D.D.C. 2oo6), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice\nPresident and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not\nparticipate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited\nby another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit.\n\nFinally, even if such materials had any conceivable <span class=\"highlight\">relevance</span> to the charges at hand (which,\nas discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the\nBOP’s records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of\ndocuments, atempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2oo5, and parsing through\natorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for atorneys for\nthe Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knous\nof no effective way to search them.
