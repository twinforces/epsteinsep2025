United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.\n36l at 3-4, 36l-7 through 36l-ll. In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 6 of 9l 6\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl which you discussed with Ms. Maxwell her right to be present\n\n2 and the indication of her knouing and <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> waiver of that\n3 right provided on this form.\n\n4 MR.

Counts One and Two arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), which, at the time of the\nalleged conduct, provided that a person could be charged with a criminal offense if she\n“knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996) (emphasis added). That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283. A substantive § 2422(a) offense is complete when an individual is\n“nersuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]” to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\nand a conspiracy to commit such an offense is complete when an agreement to “persuade[],\ninduce[], entice[], or coerce[]” an individual to engage in such travel is reached and a single\novert act is commited in furtherance of the agreement. It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2).

Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne <span class=\"highlight\">Voluntary</span> sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit.

During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue.

Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne <span class=\"highlight\">Voluntary</span> sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged ln sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida ““with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page l4 of l6\nfurther discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>. Requests to meet\nwith the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be\nscheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4, Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator's receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service.

Such reports will report on an aggregate level\nonly.

Jan. 2o2o update). Jane’s\nmotivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is essential\nto the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.\n\nPredictably, then, Mr. Glassman shared with the government the advice he gave to Jane,\nso the information was not “in fact kept confidential.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9; see also United\nStates v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487, 494 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3) (addressing assertion of atorney-client\nprivilege in respect to documents sought by the defendant in a criminal case and holding that\nprivilege did not apply because there was no evidence “the Company intended the\ncommunications to remain confidential, as it must have in order for the privilege to apply in the\nfirst instance” and because “the Company failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court that\nthe atorney-client privilege applies to the documents sought by Defendants”). The atorney-\nclient privilege thus does not apply.\n\nBut even if the privilege did apply, the privilege was waived. “It is well-established that\n<span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> disclosure of confidential material to a third party generally results in forfeiture of any\napplicable atorney-client privilege.” United States v. Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here. Mr. Glassman voluntarily communicated\nwith the government that he advised Jane to cooperate with the government because it would\n“help her case,” thereby waiving the atorney-client privilege. And as Fed. R.

Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the privilege — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived privilege. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the atorney-client communication,” placed “the atorney-client\nrelationship directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her cooperation with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s compensation fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the atorney-client relationship into the trial by atempting to use privileged\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a privilege waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s privilege, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout cooperation. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”). The defense has other avenues to suggest that cooperating with the\n3 For these reasons, the cases cited by the defense are inapposite. (Def. Leter at 3-4).

As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, traumatic personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a relationship of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming application of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”). In support of her claim that Carolyn’s\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo566\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 32 oof55\nbehavior was <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, the defendant argues that Carolyn did not do “whatever [Epstein and\nMaxwell] asked of her”—noting that Carolyn did not travel with them to Litle Saint James. (Def.\nMem. 2l). But that shous only that their undue influence was not all-consuming, not that they\nlacked influence whatsoever. The standard is “‘undue influence,’ not coercion.” United States v.\nMontijo-Maysonet, 874 F.3d 34, 52 (lst Cir. 2o2o).\n\nThe defendant also argues that application of this enhancement would constitute double-\ncounting because the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six covers her conduct\nenticing and coercing minors. (Def. Mem. 2o). This argument lacks merit. As the defendant\ncorrectly notes, “[i]mpermissible double counting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is\napplied to increase the defendant’s sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully\naccounted for by another part of the Guidelines.” Watkins, 667 F.3d at 26l. But “when the\nchallenged part of the Guidelines aim[s] at different harms emanating from the same conduct, there\nis no impermissible double counting,” and “[e]nhancements are not duplicative when they reflect\ndifferent facets of the defendant’s conduct.” Jd. at 26l-62 (alterations, citations, and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThe relevant inquiry therefore is whether the base offense level is aimed at the same harm\nas the enhancement. Here, it is not: the base offense level (which refers to § 2Gl.3) captures the\ncategory of sex offenses against minors, and § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) applies to the use of undue\ninfluence. See United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App’x 444, 446-47 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing\nthe focus of § 2Bl.3(b)(2)(B)); United States v. Arbaugh, 95l F. 3d l67, l73 (4th Cir. 2o2o) (“By\nits plain terms, § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) focuses on a different aggravating factor (undue influence) than\n§ 2Gl.3 (minor victims)... . As such, subsection (b)(2)(B) does not ‘consider’ the same factor as\nthese other Guideline provisions.”).\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3-l Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of9\nl November 2olo\n: Our ref; R/DCU/as/44-oll-VFT Response\nSUBJECT TO CONTRACT\n& WITHOUT PREJUDICE\nRE: 44 KINNERTON STREET, LONDON SWi\nPOSSIBLE <span class=\"highlight\">VOLUNTARY</span> FREEHOLD TRANSFER\nThank you for your recent enquiry regarding Miss Maxwell's interest in the possibility of\npurchasing the freehold of the above property on a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> basis.\nGrosvenor currently has a policy where we are willing to quote terms to lessees who have\nleases which were originally granted for more than 2l years.

Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

The Epstein VCP is a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program\nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.\nFeldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from atorneys representing over 7o victims, the Atorney\nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be\nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the “Administrator’), the former Deputy Special Master of the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the\nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of\ntheir September llth-related exposure.\n“This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of\npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknouledgment by an independent third party as to\nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.\n“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is\ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the\nyears of pain these victims have endured.”\n“These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,” said Mr.\nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs\nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, among others.\nThe Program provides victims with an atractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is\nspeedy and cost-effective.

The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page7of9\nfurther discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>. Requests to meet\nwith the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be\nscheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4.

General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l4 of l7\nAdministrator’s experience and judgment and consistent with the Protocol.\nThe Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative\nsupport, including but not limited to:\n\ne The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the\nClaimant.\n\ne The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse.\n\ne The nature and extent of the Claimant’s physical or psychological\ndamage resulting from the sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual\nabuse on the Claimant.\n\ne The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and\ncircumstances, supporting documentation and corroborating evidence.\n\ne Whether the Claimant previously entered into a setlement agreement\nwith Epstein and received a payment pursuant to such agreement.\n\n4. Will I have an opportunity to meet with the Administrator?\nYes. Claimants may request to meet with the Administrator, either before or\nafter the Administrator renders her determination. If you would like to\nrequest a meeting before a determination is issued, please upload a leter\nrequesting such a meeting when filing your claim (either by uploading the\nleter to the Online Claimant Portal or mailing it via U.S. mail or courier\nservice); the Administrator will contact you to schedule a meeting after she\nhas had the opportunity to review your claim file. If you would like to request\na meeting with the Administrator after the determination is issued, you can\nselect the “request a meeting” option in the determination leter and submit\nit to the Program (either by uploading the meeting request to the Online\nClaimant Portal or mailing it via U.S. mail or courier service); upon receipt,\nthe Administrator will contact you to schedule the meeting.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-7 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel QeHIBIT G\nIN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS\nDIVISION OF ST.

Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher discovery obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay.

The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> stays of their lawsuits.

Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span>\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019892.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUN DstamteHPl &Pitdd BPP POM Pagers G2o\n837 F.2d 48, 49-5o (2d Cir. l988) (overturning district court’s decision that defendant posed\na flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took “no steps” to flee\njurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home and arrest);\nUnited States v.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her <span class=\"highlight\">voluntary</span> compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6.

Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne <span class=\"highlight\">Voluntary</span> sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age’—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”*”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he ‘“wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n52 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit.
