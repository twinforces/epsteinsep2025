Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag. Tr.” refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2ol9;\n“T).

United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.\n36l at 3-4, 36l-7 through 36l-ll. In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

The transcript\nquotes the court, in pertinent part, as follous with reference to me and the article: “On a somewhat more\nserious note, don’t quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is :\nhimself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I’m\ncertain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.” Later in the :\nhearing, atorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.\nJust to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate\nor to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in\nsupport of Professor Dershouitz’s motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. :\nDershouitz, l:l9-cv-o3377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstein- /\nrelated.” My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, :\nor advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershouitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on\nanyone’s behalf in co-authoring the law journal article.\nVery truly yours,\nBruce A. Green\ncc: AUSA Maurene Comey; Martin G.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\n<span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001058.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagell7 of 2oo Sd\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl MR.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government’s\nOctober 6, 2o2o leter requesting the Court’s permission to delay the disclosure of photographs\nand documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the\n“Materials”), pursuant to Rule l6(d)(l) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny.’\n\nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule l6\nbecause the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shoun\ngood cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\n' We note that <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> we sent the government a leter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements\n\nor writen communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.\n\nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”\nDOJ-OGR-ooool795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 6\nindictment, severance of counts, disclosure of expert testimony, disclosure of materials to\npotential experts, F.R.E. 7o2 challenges to experts, and various motions in limine. Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthat the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts\nare already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.\n\nSecond, the Defense Leter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the\nGovernment’s control, but that the Government has nevertheless spent significant time addressing\nat the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that\nMDC staff has been instructed to allou defense counsel to pass papers to their client for her to\nreview during visits. Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal\ncounsel also noted that the table in the atorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier\ndoun the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-l9. Atorneys and clients are required to sit on\nopposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may\nbe reviewing in such a way that both the client and atorneys can view it while remaining on\nopposite sides of the table. Finally, the Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the\ndefendant has access to her discovery for approximately l3 hours per day and therefore receives\nmore time to review her discovery than any other inmate in the MDC.\n\nXK XK XK\n\nThe Government is working expeditiously to meet its obligations and discovery deadlines,\nwhich it takes very seriously. The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the\nproduction of discovery as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that its productions are\ncomplete.

The defense has previously\nprovided the Government with lists of documents that the defendant could not open. In response,\nthe Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformated versions of each\nidentified document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on\nthe MDC computer system. <span class=\"highlight\">Yesterday</span>, defense counsel informed the Government that the\ndefendant still cannot view certain files, but the defense has not identified all of the specific\nunreviewable documents.

We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled. <span class=\"highlight\">Yesterday</span>, we met with the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo293o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative.

Ms. Maxwell cannot have privileged communications with her counsel and\nadequately prepare for trial if the prison guards can hear what she is reviewing and\ndiscussing with counsel.\n\n= The prison guards ordered counsel to reposition her portfolio, which was being used to\nshield glare from the plexiglass divider separating counsel from Ms. Maxwell to permit\ncounsel to have a clearer view of the laptop, because the portfolio was restricting the\nguards’ view of counsel.\n\n= At one point, a prison guard interrogated counsel about what she was doing with her\nhands.

These changes have disrupted videoconferencing, which had been\nworking well, and nou severely impact atorney-client communication and the ability to\nprepare the case for trial. On counsel's end, the audio is impacted by a whirling, whistling\nsound - like water going doun a drain. The video is completely blurred, causing eye\nstrain, and compromising the sharing of documents, which are too hazy to decipher.\n\nOn the MDC end, the audio is loud and echoes, making it difficult to understand and\naudible to staff, compromising atorney-client confidentiality. The monitor- nou enclosed\nin a box with a plastic cover - is nou positioned some three to four feet away from Ms.\nMaxwell. This distance impacts Ms. Maxwell’s ability to view screen-shared\ndocuments and requires her to contort her body - back and neck - and risk further injury\nwhile atempting to see shared legal documents.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o9 _ Filed o7/ol/2l Pagellof3\nCE U.S. Department of Justice\nSE” United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

For\nthe reasons set forth belou, the defense believes that Ms. Andriano’s last name should not be\nredacted in the publicly filed version of Court Exhibit 2.\n\nThe redactions to Court Exhibit 2 were the subject of some discussion among the parties.\nThe government originally proposed that Court Exhibit 2 should be filed under seal because the\nlist of names is alphabetized and redacting only anonymized names would provide identifying\ninformation for anonymized witnesses. The defense objected to that proposal on the grounds that\nit was unnecessary and overbroad to seal the entire document and that the names of anonymized\nwitnesses could be redacted.\n\nThe defense further objected to Ms. Andriano’s name being redacted in any way due to her\nrecent post-trial interview with the Daily Mail, in which she publicly disclosed her full name and\ndeclared her intention to waive her right to anonymity.

She is not\npermited to possess and review legal documents and is not permited paper or pen. This has\nprevented her from preparing for sentencing.\n\nMs. Maxwell was abruptly removed from general population and returned to solitary\nconfinement, this time without any clothing, toothpaste, soap, legal papers, etc. She was\nprovided a “suicide smock” and is given a few sheets of toilet paper on request. This morning, a\npsychologist evaluated Ms. Maxwell and determined she is not suicidal.\n\nI met with Ms. Maxwell today (after a 97-minute delay follouing my arrival at the\nfacility). She is not suicidal. Currently, she is unable to properly prepare for sentencing. If Ms.\nMaxwell remains on suicide watch, is prohibited from reviewing legal materials prior to\nsentencing, becomes sleep deprived, and is denied sufficient time to meet with and confer with\ncounsel, we will be formally moving on Monday for an adjournment.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

The defendant will remain on suicide watch until the MDC assesses that she is no\nlonger at heightened risk of self-harm. That status will be reevaluated daily. At the same time,\nthe Warden will oversee an investigation into the safety concern that the defendant reported to the\nIG.\n\nIn the meantime, the Warden and Chief Psychologist have confirmed that the defendant\nwill be able to continue to prepare for sentencing unencumbered. After the defendant complained\nthat she was missing certain legal materials on suicide watch, MDC staff asked where in her\nproperty the papers she needed were located. In response, the defendant said the materials were\nin her property but refused to provide specifics about where within her property the materials were\nlocated. To ensure that the defendant has everything she could possibly need, MDC staff gathered\nall papers within the defendant’s property, including bins of papers, and put them all in her cell on\nsuicide watch. As a result, the defendant nou has all of her legal paperwork with her. If she\nbelieves she is missing any items, she can inform MDC staff.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant continues to have access to counsel. The defendant had a legal\nvisit <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>. The Warden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant will continue to\nbe permited to visit in person with counsel while on suicide watch. If counsel does not visit the\ndefendant today, then she will be given a legal call so that she may confer with her counsel by\nphone.\n\nWith respect to the defendant’s complaints about her conditions more generally, the\nWarden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant was given clothing this morning and\nis no longer required to wear a smock.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Counsel:\n\nI write pursuant to the Court's Order of November 23, 2o2l directing a supplement to\nthe disclosure for Certified Forensic Examiner Robert Kelso's expert opinion to the extent he\nintends to offer rebutal testimony to any opinions offered in the government's original\ndisclosure for Stephen Flatley, dated September l5, 2o2l.\n\nI note that <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> you provided a supplemental notice for Mr. Flatley. That\nsupplement was untimely. Thus, we intend to object at trial to the admission of any opinions\nfrom Mr. Flatley not included in your September l5, 2o2l disclosure. This supplement for\nMr. Kelso does not purport to respond to anything contained in your Flatley supplement.\n\nWe anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the meaning of certain pieces of\nmetadata associated with computers and computer files, such as “Authors,” “Last saved by,”\n“Registered Organization,” and “Registered Owner” and potentially others. Mr. Kelso will\ntestify about where the data contained in these types of metadata fields originates and hou it\npropagates. Mr. Kelso will testify that a particular value in one or more of these metadata\nfields, such as a version of person’s name, does not necessarily mean that person authored the\nunderlying documents or had any interaction with the documents. This testimony may cover\nany exhibits offered by the Government.\n\nMr. Kelso's testimony may also encompass the metadata associated with defense\nexhibits, including testimony about the values contained in certain metadata fields and their\nmeaning. Because the defense cannot anticipate at this juncture which exhibits may be\nnecessary, depending upon evidence offered by the government during its case in chief, the\ndefense reserves the right to disclose the metadata testimony from Mr. Kelso at the same time\nit identifies any particular exhibit that it will introduce as impeachment or rebutal exhibits.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of4\ntheory of Bovino’s relevance since mid-October, when the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial. Yet the defendant did not subpoena Bovino until November 3o, 2o2l. And as the\ndefendant admits, she has not been in contact with Bovino since the service of the subpoena, two\nand a half weeks ago.\n\nThe Government rested on Friday, November lo, 2o2l, as it had previewed for several\ndays prior. Follouing that time, the defendant had five days without trial during which to prepare\nthe defense case-in-chief. On the day the Government rested, the defendant suggested that the\ndefense case would last only a few days, and as recently as <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, the defendant suggested that\nshe would rest today, but for one witness who might carry over to Monday. Tr. 2534.\n\nIt was not until this morning that the defendant brought Bovino’s apparent noncompliance\nto the Court’s atention. It also appears that the defense would otherwise rest today. The defendant\nhas slept on her rights, and the Court should not sign the arrest warrant or grant a continuance to\nallou the Marshals time to find Bovino and bring her to Court.\n\nIt is well setled that a “district court has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion to\ncontinue.” See United States v. Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *3 (2d Cir. Nov. 3, 2o2l). That\nprinciple applies with full force where a defendant belatedly seeks to compel a witness to atend\ntrial. In United States v. King, 762 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir. l985), superseded by statute on other\ngrounds as stated in United States v. Khatami, 28o F.3d 9o7, 9l2 (9th Cir. 2oo2), the Circuit\naffirmed a district court’s denial of a motion to continue so that an incarcerated witness could be\nproduced. The defendant waited until two days before trial to seek production of the witness, and\nthe Circuit ruled that “any detriment suffered by [the defendant] resulted from his oun dilatory\nconduct and not from the court’s ruling.” Jd. at 235. “Such tactics provide no basis for a ruling\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Page8ofl6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Eight\nmay be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct\ntestimony.”°? Maxwell also appears to have sought subpoenas directed to “four individuals\nseek[ing] similar materials,” including EVCP materials, a request this Court denied in August\n2o2l, again without prejudice to renewal.*°\n\nOn November l5, 2o2l, we learned that Maxwell sought leave to serve a subpoena on\nMs. Feldman for certain EVCP documents and that the Court intended to authorize the subpoena.\nThat same day, we informed the Court that we were authorized to accept service of the subpoena\nand that Ms. Feldman intended to move to quash it. We received a copy of the subpoena on\nNovember l6, 2o2l. The subpoena requests four categories of materials from four individual\nvictims: (i) “EVCP Material” (as defined in the subpoena) for the four victims; (ll)\ncommunications between the EVCP and the four victims “and/or their Atorneys”; (il) copies of\npayments to the victims “and/or their Atorneys”; and (iv) any releases that the four victims\nexecuted.\n\nThe government filed its motion to quash the subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, which provides ample\nbasis to quash the subpoena. Ms. Feldman sets forth the follouing additional reasons to quash\nthe subpoena.\n3° Order at 7-8 (ECF No. 252).\n© Opinion and Order, dated Aug. l3, 2o2l, at 2, 5, lo (ECF No. 334).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Page3oof43 3\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl I got supplemental briefing on to discuss.

Because\nl8 there are many of them and because they include things like\nl9 criminal convictions that are beyond the scope of 6o9 and other\n2o personal information that might either identify anonymized\n2l witnesses or embarrass witnesses, we would ask to be able to\n22 submit briefing rather than raise those issues on the public\n23 record.\n24 THE COURT: You can, but not until you have further\n25 discussion and narrou disputes, because that's going to happen.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll624\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page5of lo6 5\nLBTVMAXl\nl the routine during trial or may we all participate?\n2 THE COURT: I think it's just a distancing question to\n3 make sure that we have sufficient space.

But when you\nl2 compare the phone numbers -- and there are a variety of\nl3 different phone numbers throughout the book -- it becomes clear\nl4 that Caroline is the same Carolyn, first and last name, as some\nl5 of the other messages, because there's continuity between the\nl6 phone numbers.\n\nl7 And there are a variety of different phone numbers\nl8 throughout the exhibits with different names like Carolyn,\nl9 Caroline, and Carolyn with a last name. And reviewing them and\n2o analyzing them makes it clear throughout the books and across a\n2l variety of different dates that we're talking about the same\n22 person. And so that facilitates both publishing the exhibits\n23 so that the jury can see them for the first time, and doing\n24 that in a way that sort of connects up those different\n25 exhibits.

To say\nlo no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand\nll the question well enough to be able to say no.\nl2 Pointing to just the motivating factor language I\nl3 think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remind\nl4 them of the whole instruction, including that it's a violation\nl5 of New York penal law that's charged and is the illegal sexual\nl6 activity that they're considering.\nl7 So, for those reasons, I am in the same place.\nl8 I did want to make a litle bit of an additional\nl9 record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the\n2o instructions that I gave <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> regarding that slightly\nal extended schedule.\n22 I asked the jury to make themselves available to\n23 deliberate until at least 6:oo today, which is a one-hour\n24 extension of what's largely been our schedule.

One is that the jury is\nl3 considering whether or not they can convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nl4 substantive offense in Count Four based solely on events that\nl5 took place in New Mexico and traveled to and from New Mexico.\nl6 THE COURT: There are a number of assumptions in that\nl7 that don't necessarily derive from the meaning of that leter,\nl8 but I understand that is your position.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.\n2o And I think the second point is that they are Looking\n2l at the instructions that they have been given thus far because\n22 they reference the second element of Count Four. So they're\n23 looking at that instruction and they are unclear, they are\n24 confused by those instructions.

Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell conviction is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\n<span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015127.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o6 Filed o8/o6/25 Pagelof3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n2o Cr. 33o (PAE)\n-\\y-\nORDER\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\nPAUL A.

And so no relief is appropriate here.\n\n3 At botom, your Honor, the jury asked a question and\n\n4 nothing more. There is no reason to speculate about what the\n\n5 jury might be concluding. The jury has been accurately\n\n6 instructed on the law and that's all that's required here.\n\n7 Going beyond that to speculate about the jury's deliberations\n\n8 and compound speculation upon speculation to send back\n\n9 confusing legal instructions would compound the problem here.\nlo The simple course is exactly the course the Court took\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, which is to refer the jury to a thorough and\n\nl2 complete and accurate legal instruction. There can't be any\n\nl3 dispute that the instructions that the Court has given are\n\nl4 accurate, and that's all that's required here.\n\nl5 THE COURT: I suppose an additional point, just\n\nl6 looking at the -- I mean, the defense's new proposed\n\nl7 instruction talks about Count Two, which wasn't asked about.\n\nl8 Also, it has -- so it has three paragraphs. The first one is\nl9 about Count Two, which wasn't asked about. There is a second\n2o paragraph. And then the third paragraph I think is just wrong,\n2l an intent that Jane engaged in sexual activity in any state\n22 other than New York cannot form the basis of these elements.\n23 That would suggest it may have no relevance. This is the same\n24 discussion we've had a couple of times, Mr. Everdell.

I think this\n3 is the same basic discussion that we've had. So, in addition\n\n4 to my reasoning <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, I think the proposal made by the\n\n5 defense is wrong.\n\n6 I continue to not knou hou to parse the jury's\n\n7 question exactly, other than to knou that they are asking about\n8 Count Four, the defense's original suggestion to just point to\n9 the motivating factor I rejected language or to say no. To say\nlo no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand\nll the question well enough to be able to say no.\nl2 Pointing to just the motivating factor language I\nl3 think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remind\nl4 them of the whole instruction, including that it's a violation\nl5 of New York penal law that's charged and is the illegal sexual\nl6 activity that they're considering.\nl7 So, for those reasons, I am in the same place.\nl8 I did want to make a litle bit of an additional\nl9 record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the\n2o instructions that I gave <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> regarding that slightly\nal extended schedule.\n22 I asked the jury to make themselves available to\n23 deliberate until at least 6:oo today, which is a one-hour\n24 extension of what's largely been our schedule.

I understand it's been rejected by the Court.\n\nll I think from the defense point of view, I think two\n\nl2 things are very clear from this note. One is that the jury is\nl3 considering whether or not they can convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nl4 substantive offense in Count Four based solely on events that\nl5 took place in New Mexico and traveled to and from New Mexico.\nl6 THE COURT: There are a number of assumptions in that\nl7 that don't necessarily derive from the meaning of that leter,\nl8 but I understand that is your position.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.\n2o And I think the second point is that they are Looking\n2l at the instructions that they have been given thus far because\n22 they reference the second element of Count Four. So they're\n23 looking at that instruction and they are unclear, they are\n24 confused by those instructions.

Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021272.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA_o8 3536o38, Pageloo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file.

The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span> that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n“4 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023110.tif": "we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation <span class=\"highlight\">yesterday</span>,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

Anyone\nwho reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to\nobject on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking\nobjections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.\nBEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you\nfiled against Mr. Epstein for $5o,ooo,ooo.oo [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.\nll. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your\navailability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation\nplans.\n\nFinally, your leter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The\ndeposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of\nherself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —\nwere numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well knou that we provided the court\nreporter with color copies, which will be atached to the deposition transcript. You also\nknou that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the\ndeposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs\nwhen you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,\nlast week after she was already under subpoena.\n\nI hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.\nVery truly ygurs,\n\nf\nMichaeRR.
