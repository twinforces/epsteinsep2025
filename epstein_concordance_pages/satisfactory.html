Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a <span class=\"highlight\">satisfactory</span>\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl4\nFlight is, at most, circumstantial evidence of guilt and its probative value “depends upon\nthe degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s\nbehavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to\nconsciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt\n\nconcerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.” Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424\n\n(quoting Myers, 55o F.2d at lo49). “Because of the inherent unreliability of evidence of flight,\n\nand the danger of prejudice its use may entail, a flight instruction is improper unless the evidence\n\nis sufficient to furnish reasonable support for all four of the necessary inferences.” Myers, 55o\n\nF.2d at lo5o (internal citations omited). An adequate evidentiary predicate “must include some\n\nevidence surrounding the failure to appear ... and must thereby provide the jury with more than\n\nan opportunity for mere conjecture and speculation.” United States v. Sanchez, 79o F.2d 245,\n\n252 (2d Cir. l986) (internal quotations and citations omited) (emphasis in original).\n\nIl. The Government Should Not Be Permited to Introduce Evidence of Alleged\n“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After Epstein’s Death Is Proof of\nConsciousness of Guilt\nThe government cannot establish a <span class=\"highlight\">satisfactory</span> factual predicate for the jury to infer that\n\nMs. Maxwell was, in fact, fleeing or evading law enforcement authorities after the arrest of\n\nJeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct is proof of consciousness of guilt. The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys. As previously discussed,\n\nMs. Maxwell also addressed and rebuted each point that the government referenced in its bail\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5696", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological For the purpose of the study, only the total score was\n\nparents were living together (yes/no).
