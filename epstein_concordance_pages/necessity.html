Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the <span class=\"highlight\">necessity</span> of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 7 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The S2\nindictment tripled the scope of the time frame at issue and expanded both the scope and type of\nconduct on trial, necessitating a re-review of millions of pages of discovery (most of which is not\nOCR or search capable), multiplying the type of experts needed for trial, and altering the\nCOVID-challenging worldwide investigation to a new set of hundreds of witnesses. Layered\nonto this complexity, Ms. Maxwell still has not been provided an opportunity to review the entire\nset of discovery provided last November because the government-provided laptop and hard-\ndrives are missing critical data and software; even her counsel is unable to access significant\nportions of the “old” discovery. Nor has Ms. Maxwell been afforded any opportunity to review\nthe “new” 2o,ooo-plus pages of, essentially, Brady material produced last week by the\ngovernment related to 225 non-testifying witnesses.

Here, there\nis no dispute that (l) AUSA |g representations to Judge McMahon were false and\nmisleading, (i) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the\nsubpoena if AUSA gg had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA gg statements\nwere deliberately false, since he had a “complete handle on the landscape” months before he\nappeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon.\n\nNor need Maxwell prove “outrageous government conduct” to obtain relief. Were that\nher burden, houever, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. “The concept of fairness embodied\nin the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is\nfundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of Justice.” United States v.

Juror 5o’s\nfalse answers undermined the voir dire process this and other courts follou, including reliance on\nwriten questionnaires, to screen for jurors who, due to their prior experiences, cannot be trusted\nto be fair in the individual case. What happened here is a structural error: “a defendant is ‘entitled\nto be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.’” United States v.

THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN IMPARTIAL JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth Amendment explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an impartial jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly difficult in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessity</span> of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.

Just as judges must recuse themselves to protect the appearance of\n\nimpartiality, see Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 886 (2oo9), judges must\n\nensure that jurors, as judges of the facts, are also impartial in appearance as well as in reality.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9llo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009306.jpg": "Case eieaceeicliaeaiaiaiy Na+, \\, Maiacuneenineialide l7 of l3o\n245\nC2GFDAUl Hearing\nl THE DEPUTY CLERK: Continued case of United States of\n2 America v.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of <span class=\"highlight\">necessity</span> to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was scheduled\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.tif": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.
