The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena. The Defendant’s motion to authorize\nservice of the Subpoena on BSF should be denied.!\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas\nin criminal proceedings. Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\nl A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to intervene\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 _ Filed o3/26/2l Page 4of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 4 of 7\nbecause “the subpoena was not crafted to call for admissible evidence. Rather, it called for the\nproduction of the entire investigative file and is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).\n\nSimilarly, Request l2 asks for “EVCP Material,” which is defined as “any submission to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims on behalf of\npersons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases\nsigned by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your Clients.” This\nRequest does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is not a party or otherwise privy to\nwhat information BSF has submited to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nor on behalf of which clients BSF has submited such information. The Defendant cannot merely\nrequest every piece of confidential information that BSF submited to the Program in the hopes\nthat something relevant and admissible turns up. This Request thus cannot pass muster under Rule\nl7(c).\n\nSecond, although BSF does not knou what arguments the Defendant made in her ex parte\nmotion, the documents and items requested in the Subpoena bear no apparent relevance to the\nDefendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this mater. And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c). Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo, 7ol.\n\nRequest l seeks communications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney about the Defendant\nfrom 2ol5 through the present, and Requests 3 through 5 seek communications between BSF and\nBSF’s co-counsel from 2ol5 through the present regarding any meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears JM).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2oll). Given\nthe marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will be unable to\ndemonstrate a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and its co-counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl9l Filed o3/3o/2l Pagelof7\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\nteen FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c).

But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena issued to BSF for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears to be BSF).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2oll). Given\nthe marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will be unable to\ndemonstrate a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and its co-counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo288o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003022.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 239\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nThe defendant’s motion is, at its core, premised on a false factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span>. The defendant\nalleges, based on a New York Daily News article, that Boies Schiller and the Government colluded\nstarting in at least early 2ol6 with the “precise[] design[]” of having the defendant “charged with\nperjury.” (Def. Mot. 3 at lo). In particular, she claims that Boies Schiller met with the\nGovernment in February 2ol6, urged the Government to open an investigation of Epstein and\nMaxwell, told the Government what was in its files, and met with the Government again in the\nsummer of 2ol6 to ask if it would consider charging the defendant with perjury after her two\ndepositions. (/d. at 2, 8).\n\nThat is not so. While a nou former Assistant United States Atorney (““AUSA-l”) met\nwith a lawyer from Boies Schiller and two other atorneys about Epstein in February 2ol6, that\nmeeting was not focused on the defendant, and AUSA-l did not participate in a second meeting\nwith those atorneys. Moreover, that February 2ol6 meeting pre-dated the depositions that gave\nrise to the perjury counts in the Indictment, which itself was obtained more than four years\nthereafter.° The Indictment was instead the product of an investigation that was not opened until\nlate 2ol8 and that had nothing to do with a meeting that had taken place nearly three years earlier\nwith an AUSA who played no part in the decision to open the 2ol8 investigation and similarly\nplayed no part in the 2ol8 investigation itself.\n\nl. The Civil Lawsuit against Maxwell\n\nIn or about September 2ol5, Giuffre, represented by Boies Schiller, filed a civil defamation\nlawsuit against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.\n°6 While, as discussed herein, the Government has uncovered evidence of a phone call from one\nof the atorneys, Stan Potinger, to AUSA-l in early May 2ol6, AUSA-l has no specific memory\nof that call, nor did AUSA-l provide any notes or records of that call to the team working on the\ninstant investigation.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o22\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 239\nregarding hou the defendant is alleged to have commited the crimes charged in Counts One\nthrough Four. See Indictment 9 l-ll. Indeed, “by providing Defendant with a <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> of the\nmanner in which Defendant is alleged to have commited the charged offenses, the Indictment\nprovides Defendant with more detail than is strictly necessary” under the governing law. United\nStates v. Kozel, No. l9 Cr. 46o (KMW), 2o2o WL 475l498, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2o2o).\n\nAlthough the defendant complains that some of the terms used in the speaking portions of\nthe Indictment are somehou vague, she cites no authority to suggest that her difficulty\ncomprehending basic language in portions of a charging instrument that do not speak to the\nelements of the offense requires dismissal.°> Counts One and Three, charging the defendant with\nviolations of l8 U.S.C § 37l, “clearly contain[] the elements of the offense charged, fairly inform[]\n[her] of the charge[s] against [her], and enable[] [her] to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of\nfuture prosecution for the same offense.” United States v. Bunn, l54 F. App’x 227, 229 (2d Cir.\n2oo5). Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific reference to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’). In any event, whether grooming alone\nconstitutes a crime is immaterial to the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide whether\nthe evidence at trial, as a whole, establishes the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page2of4l\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nl.

In relevant part, Dr. Dietz opines:\ne “False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are multiple pathways to these\nfalse allegations of sexual assault.” (/d. at 7).\n> The disclosure also notes that “Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant” (id. at 7), but as he has not disclosed what opinions he may have\nabout Epstein’s sexual behavior, he has not provided adequate notice as to them and the\nGovernment does not address them further herein except to note that it will object if he atempts\nto offer them. See, e.g., United States v. Valle, No. l2 Cr. 847 (PGG), 2ol3 WL 44o687, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y.

UPS Ground Freight, Inc., No. l6 Civ. 36, 2ol7\nWL 59o5575, at *2 (N.D. Fl. Jul. 25, 2ol7) (citations and internal quotation marks omited). So\ntoo here.?\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions on hindsight bias to “temper” the jurors’\nassessment of the evidence is thus virtually unprecedented. If this Court alloued such testimony\nin this case, houever, it would likely become much more common. This Court should decline to\nopen the door to the routine psychoanalysis of the jury in this way.\n\n3. Opinions as to the “Halo Effect”\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions concerning the “Halo effect”—.e., that “the positive evaluation of\none characteristic has a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual\nare evaluated” (Ex. A at 5)—are irrelevant to any issue to be considered by the jury and appear to\nbe offered in an effort to encourage jury nullification by engendering sympathy for the defendant,\nas well as to offer a factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> based on no reliable evidence through a witness plainly\nincompetent to do so.\n\nNone of the charges in this case relate in any way to the defendant’s appraisal of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s character or whether the defendant did or did not view him in the manner suggested by\nthe Halo effect. Simply put, if every word that Dr. Dietz said regarding the “Halo effect” and\nEpstein’s “brilliance” in exploiting it were taken as true, the defendant would be guilty if she met\nthe elements of the charged offenses—exactly as she would be if every word Dr. Dietz said on this\n3 Accordingly, even if the defense somehou put at issue whether a witness’s opinion on some\nmater was affected by hindsight bias—and the Government cannot currently envision hou this is\nlikely—the proper way of litigating an issue so squarely within the ken of the jury is through lay\nevidence and argument, not expert testimony. See deWit, 2ol7 WL 59o5575, at *2.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo623o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2l of 4l\n\nCompounding the improper nature of this testimony, the defense appears to seek to use Dr.\nDietz to opine as to a complex factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> that no reliable process of psychiatric evaluation\ncould produce. Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case. See, e.g., Island Intell.\n> This would not be the first unreliable factual claim made by Dr. Dietz, who testified in a previous\ncriminal case that a defendant got the idea of drouning her children in the bathtub from an episode\nof Law & Order in which a defendant did so and was acquited on an insanity defense, when in\nfact no such episode existed. See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case. See Yates v. State, l7l S.W.3d 2l5, 222 (Tex. App. 2oo5).\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 4l\nProp., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts to act as . .. vehicles for factual\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span>”). This “opinion” should be precluded.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\nassault do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury. There will be no dispute that allegations\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3o of 4l\n\n2. “[Hlou memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.”\n\n3. “[T]he mechanism by which false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result\nof post-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence or the like.”\n\n4. “(T]he effects of suggestion on memory,” including hou “[s]uggestive activities can\nexplain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory of sexual abuse, and even denying\nsexual abuse, to later having [memories] for numerous abusive acts, if the memories are false.”\n\n5. “[T] he characteristics of false and/or distorted memories” . . . “[i]n particular,” that:\n\na.

Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, memory, perception, and the fallibility of human recall—that is, hou\npeople may remember, misremember, or forget past events—are within the ken of the jury. See\nUnited States v. Carter, 4lo F.3d 942, 95o (7th Cir. 2oo5) (“In general . . . jurors understand that\nmemory can be less than perfect.”); United States v. Smith, l48 F.

Discussion\n\nAs set forth herein, although the Government acknouledges that testimony about memory\nmay be proper in response to Dr. Rocchio, Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony does not satisfy the\nDaubert standard. Specifically, the Government objects to any atempt by the defense to offer her\ntestimony as to (a) opinions as to false memory formation that are unreliable or do not fit the facts\nof the case, (b) commonsense principles within the ken of the jury, (c) opinions bearing on witness\ncredibility and demeanor, and (d) factual narratives about the case.\n\nl. Opinions as to False Memory Formation\n\nDr. Loftus offers the follouing opinion on false memory formation that is unreliable and\nlacks fit to the case:\n\ne Hou false memories may be created through post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, and influence, as described in Paragraph 3 above.\n\nThis opinion on false memory formation is central to Dr. Loftus’s testimony, but the\ndefense has not carried its burden of establishing its reliability. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3;\nDaubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589. As an initial mater, the defense expert notice provides no information\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4. Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> about the case:\n\ne Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span>... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3of 29\nJournal of Forensic Psychology Practice, l2:97-l23, 2ol2\nCopyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC a ROUE age\nISSN: l522-8932 print/l522-9o92 online\nDOT: lo.lo8o/l5228932.2ol2.65oo7l\nAREA REVIEWS\nPathways to False Allegations\nof Sexual Assault\nJESSICA ENGLE, BA\nDepartment of Clinical Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada\nWILLIAM O’DONOHUE, PhD\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true.

Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span>: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993).

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 36 of 375\n\nCeci, S.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page/7ofl7\nspecifically is inadmissible as a vehicle for factual <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> based on only limited writen\nrecords. /d. at l7.\n\nThe Court first concludes that Dr. Dietz’s general opinion on the existence of a\nphenomenon called “the halo effect” is admissible. The testimony may be relevant to the jury’s\ndetermination of Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge because it could explain hou, for example, Ms.\nMaxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse but without any intent or knouledge of that\nresult. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion of nullification can be addressed with a\nlimiting instruction.\n\nThe Court will, houever, without a further shouing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.\nDietz from applying the halo effect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with\n“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders” that “alloued him to use\nhis brilliance to manipulate people.” Notice at 6-7. Dr. Dietz never met or examined Epstein\nbut instead bases this opinion on documents that he reviewed, including media interviews of\nEpstein, evidence from the Florida investigation of Epstein, and materials produced in this\nlitigation. Jd. at 6; Def. Br., Ex. l at l66-68. But neither Dr. Dietz nor the Defense has offered\nsupport for the claim that this is a reliable means by which an expert in Dr. Dietz’s field would\ndiagnose an individual. Typically, federal courts admit an expert diagnosis of a personality\ndisorder only if the expert personally interviewed the diagnosed individual. F.g., Tchatat v. City\nof New York, 3l5 F.R.D. 44l, 445-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6); United States v. Falcon, 245 F. Supp. 2d\nl239, l244 (S.D. Fla. 2oo3); see also Tardif 'v. City of New York, 344 F.

The Court would exclude Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis for much the same\nreasons that court identified. First, the Defense has offered no evidence that diagnosis without\nany in-person interview is a reliable and accepted method in Dr. Dietz’s field. /d. at 446.\nSecond, even if reliable, the opinion risks significant Rule 4o3 prejudice because the jury is\nlikely to overweigh Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis. /d. at 447.

Instead, jurors may consider the applicability of the halo effect based on\nevidence in the record, including the anticipated testimony of multiple individuals that interacted\ndirectly with Epstein.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz expects to testify that because victims of sexual assault often develop\npost-traumatic stress disorder, they avoid situations and feelings that are likely to bring on\nsymptoms of PTSD, including contact with their abusers or wearing clothes gifted by their\nabusers. Notice at ll. The Defense explains that this testimony is relevant because it would\nmean that evidence of alleged victims interacting with Ms. Maxwell or Epstein after they have\nallegedly been abused is probative of whether their allegations of abuse are credible. Def. Br. at\nl5-l6. The Government argues that this opinion blames victims for their abuse, that it does not\nfit the facts of this case because the abuse was not accomplished by physical force, and that Dr.\nDietz does not have a reliable basis for the opinion. Gov’t Br. at 23-25.\n\nThe Court will admit this opinion. Dr. Dietz’s notice includes several citations to studies\nthat link victims of sexual abuse to PTSD, which the Court finds to be a reliable basis for the\nopinion. Notice at ll. The Government may of course cross-examine Dr. Dietz about contrary\nresearch.

As\npart of this last opinion, the notice states that “Dr. Loftus would identify some of the suggestive\nactivities that occurred in the current case.” /d. at 2.\n\nThe Government seeks to exclude most or all of these opinions because they are\nunreliable, fall within the ken of the jury, impermissibly bear on witness credibility, or act as\nvehicles for factual narratives of the case.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes.

These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury.

Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name.

Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021719.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page72 of 93\n59\n\nC. Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and\ndetermined that Juror 5o’s inadvertent errors on the\njury questionnaire did not undermine Maxwell’s right\nto a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage\nwith Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-\ning that Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-\ntently absurd.” (Br.63).

She explained that his answers were\n“logical explanations and generally internally con-\nsistent,” given in a “calm and straightforward man-\nner.” (/d.). Juror 5o’s explanations were consistent\nwith “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir\ndire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history\nwas not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”\n(Id.).

The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at... hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jomned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.tif": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\n<span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025387.jpg": "Page ll82\nBP-AoS63\nMULTI-LEVEL MORTALITY REVIEW U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nci FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\na\nDate: o9/o9/2ol9\nTo: Office of Quality Management\nFrom: MCC New York Health Services\nSubject: Mortality Review for Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54\nInst: MCC-NY.\nName: Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. # __763l8-o54\nDOD: o8/lo/2ol9 DOB: ol/2o/l953 _ Age: 66 Sex: Male Race: __ White\nPlace of Death: — Inst. ¥% Community Hospital __.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous |\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and |\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of |\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tumed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office handed doun one indictment of |\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-E] (cirea the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . zy\nfounder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half my —o |\nsources on the island are Jewish socialites.” (\\Q .. i—=> No ot CaP ane Bor fe yoeslee\nLambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have touho\ndo time. William Kennedy Smith in l99l, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction. 7 Ss\nMaybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big ap hd\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrae] supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu v\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (leak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer ate in :\nregard to the l4-year-old, ho wv «A a> WHA b\nOf course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> seem to derive more from Je Wi A\nEdgar Allan Poe’s psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth’s sociological comedies. Epstein is —\nlicensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shouer on the first floor was\ngiven over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had\na Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhte eho orinthia.clickshilitv com/nt/entTackeieonee lle= Thet Rantseier EUG Recida Rewes!

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest\nstories in the police <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\nhtn-/ww_orinthi s.clickahilitv eomivalent antennae Pena That Pantaciee de Reco Request Noy A aeRRe\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031411.jpg": "a\n\na ee OR ae ee cn Pe ne ee a oe\n-Date: 9/ol/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT: Page: %\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase Number . : l-o3-ool498 SPECIAL NOTES =:\n\nOccur From Date: lo/o5/o3 o824 Occur To Date : lo/o5/o3 o824\n\nReport Date . :; lo/o5/o3 o845 Day Of Week . : Sunday\nCommon/Location: 358 EL BRILLO wy\n\nCity .. . . . : PALM BEACH, FL\n\nLocation Type : RESIDENCE-SINGLE FAMILY\n\nBeat Assignment: SHIFT 2 Map Reference : lo\n\nDept Class . . : BURGLARY RESIDENCE Report Officer : DESMARAIS, WENDY\n\nCase Status . : EXCEPTIONALLY CLEARED Case Status Dt : lo/l5/o3\n\nSupervisory Dt.: FRICK, RONALD lo/o5/o3\n\nEntry Date . . : OREGERO, LAURA lo/o6/o3\n\nNames? . ... i Property? . . :\n\nVehicles? ..: Offenses? ..:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Narrative</span>? ..: Related Cases? :\n\nInterfaces? .:\n\nKEKKeKKKK DRO PERT Y INFORMA T ION # LKR EE RR KRKEKKKEKEEKKAK KKK\nCase number . : l-o3-ool498\n\nCategory . . . : **MISC OR UNFOUNDED PROP *t\n\nDescription . : PISTOL Colgr-- < we < 3\n\nSerial number : Make ... . - : GLOCK\n\nModel .... =: UCR Prop Type : FIREARMS\n\nProperty type : HANDGUN Insured? . «= 3\n\nInsured by .. : NCIC number . :\n\nValue... . : l,ooo.oo Recovered by . ;\n\nRecovered Date : o/oo/oo Recovery value : o.oo\n\nStreet number =:\n\nDrug? 2 « « 48 Document? - = 5\n\nProperty Msg . : Property Seq . :\n\nkkkekkeeee DR OPERTY INFORMATION # 2 REKKKKEKKEKEEKKKKKKKEH\nCase number . : l-o3-ool498 Category . . . : *STOLEN/RECOVERED*\nDescription . : U.S.CURRENCY ROLGE «) « hee? &\n\nSerial number : ; Make =< ae os. 4 3\n\nModel ....: UCR Prop Type : CURRENCY, NOTE, ETC.\nProperty type : CURRENCY/NEGOTIABLE Insured? ... :\n\nInsured by . . : NCIC number. :\n\nValue .... : 2,7oo.oo Recovered by . :\n\nRecovered Date : lo/l3/o3 Recovery value : 2,7oo.oo\n\nStreet number :\n\nClty 6. «2 « }\n\nDENG?  <hwie «3 Document? . . :\n\nProperty Msg . : Property Seq . :\n\netkkkekee*eE PERS ON REPORTING INFO - € l #tk te KKS\n\nCase Number . : l+o3-ool498 Last Name . . : KELLEN, SARAH LYNNELLE\n\nStreet Number : 3ol E 66TH ST loN\n\nCity .. . . . !

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nhtn-//Awww nrinthis.clickahilitv.com/pt/cot?action=cnt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\n\no7/26/l7 Page 25 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\na DOJ-OGR-ooo32o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032066.jpg": "\"  BLYllY2oo8 2l:25 BBL Edadden * PAGE 87\nThe Fantasist Page / oly\n| Ovi A SLA pe prong wine\nwaterway to the Palm Beach County state atorney's office, but the state atorney apparently saw the\nmain witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and ;\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of = #f\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tummed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney's office handed doun one indictment of\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strong!y doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . A\nfounder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half my jo} boy\nsources on the island are Jewish socialites.” flo _— —— nol ot et ort, yee\nLambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have tol hd)\ndo time.

Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big opal\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrael supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu aT\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (pak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer stated in ;\nregard to the l4-year-old. ‘ Liected\ni , hou wither Wer\nOf course, that might be evidence.

One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had\na Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoytess and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhtn-/hanana nvinthis clickahility.com/nt/ent?action=cot& title=ThetFantasist&expire=Surl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 27 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032067.jpg": "The Fantasist raye oui 7\nNext: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong.\nThe police <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgar and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest\nstories in the police <span class=\"highlight\">narrative</span> are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\n4 Yentord = |\nhtn:/hanans meinthic clickahility eam/nt/ent?action=ent&tle=ThetFantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 28 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032286.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: a\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368\nSPECIAL NOTES : DO NOT RELEASE Occur From Date: l/27/o5 oooo\nOccur To Date : l/27/o5 oooo Report Date . : 3/l4/o5 l6oo\nDay Of Week . : Thursday\nStreet Number : 358 EL BRILLO WY\nCity .. . . . +: PALM BEACH, FL\nLocation Type : RESIDENCE-SINGLE FAMILY\nBeat Assignment: DETECTIVE BUREAU Map Reference : lo\nDept Class . . : SEXUAL BATTERY Report Officer : PAGAN, MICHELE\nCase Status . : OPEN / ACTIVE Case Status Dt : 3/l4/o5\nSupervisory Dt.: TRYLCH, JEFFREY 3/l4/o5\nEntry Date . . : OREGERO, LAURA 4/o6/o5\nNAMES? «. 4 «) » \"f Property? . .« :\nVehicles? .. =: Offenses? .. :\n<span class=\"highlight\">Narrative</span>? .. =: Related Cases? :\nREKKKKKEKEK VY EH ICLE I NFORMATI.ION # L BKK KKEKKEKKRKEKREKKEKKEEEKEEE\nCase number . : l-o5-ooo368 Category... :\nState Veh Type : Weam a. fw =» & o\nMARG asi ws + + % Model -ip os ?\nModel Name .. : Permit Number =:\nStyle. «4. « 3 Color -\"Fop . :\nColor - Botom : License # .. :\nWM is so ha iy Stolen value .: o\nDisposition .: Insured ...:\nInsured by .. : Keys in car . :\nVehicle locked : Lein holder . :\nDate recovered : o/oo/oo Recovery value : o\nStreet number =:\nChey es) $s bees\nRecovery code : NCIC number. :\nBe On Look Out?:\nkkkkkKEKKK PERS ON REPORTING INFO | KKK KKK KEK\ncame Ruaber sf l-o5-ooo35o » i Eawt Maes ;:—\nStreet Number : i:\nCity .. . . . : WEST PALM BEACH, FL 334l2\nBirth Date/Age : 7/24/l98o 24 Employer? .. :\nOccupation .. : Oper Lic No. . : as) FL\nHome Phone No. : Po Race ... . » + White\nSx . « « « « & Bemale Hexgne . - 2. 5 lG\nWelght. .« «. » 3 o Other Phone Nbr:\nKEKKKKKKKKKEKKK SUS PECT/ARRESTEE INFORMATION - #l **\nCase Number . =: l-o5-ooo368 Prompt valid in: ROBSON, HALEY\nStreet Number : l2247 72ND CT NORTH\nCity ... . . : [—ERRRRMF.. 334l2l46o\nBirth Date . . : 4/o9/l986 l8 Maximum Age . =: l8\nEmployer? .. : Occupation. . :\nOper Lic No. . : Po Home Phone No. :\nOther Phone Nbr: Race ... . . : White\nSex .. . . . : Female Minimum Height : o\nMinimum Weight : o Maximum Height : o\no7/26/l7 Page l973 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032296.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: a i\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nweaget . «.« » 2 G Person Type . : OTHER PERSON\nOther Phone Nbr: ;\nREKKEKEKE O T HER PERSON INFORMATION -—- § 9 ¥*kkkkeK\nCase Number . : l-o5-ooo368 Last Name . . :\nStreet Number :\nREE sw 6 ee we OF\nBirth Date/Age : Employer? .. :\nOccupation . . : Oper Lic No... :\nHome Phone No. : 56l/ooo-oooo Race... . . : White\nSex .... . : Female Height . i“. . 2 @\nWeight ....: o Person Type . : OTHER PERSON\nOther Phone Nbr: 56l/ooo-oooo\nKkkKkkKkKkKkKkKkkKkkkkkkkkkkkkkkeekKeE <span class=\"highlight\">NARRATIVE</span> # L EERE KKKEKKEKKEKEKKEKEKEKKEKKEKKEKK\nOriginal Report LO Reported By: PAGAN, MICHELE D. 9/2o/o5\nEntered By.: OREGERO, LAURA D. 9/2o/o5\nOn2o3e/d4e/2oo5peDereceived a call” from a woman who did not wish*™to\nidentify herself.

Recarey to a room designated as\nthe Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the\nleft side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware siting on floor\nnext to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or\nfeatures indicating a make or model. This CPU was pouered off with\nthe pouer cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the\nCPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,\nprinter, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I\nobserved an A/V card with RCA jacks atached. This type of hardware\nwould allou audio and video to be dounloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.\nThe ends of the RCA jacks were unatached at the time of the search\nand no external camera was located within this room.\nThe CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel\nLCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative\nof a second computer; houever, no other computer was found. It\nappeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the\ncables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same\narea. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,\ni.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is\ncommonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media\nwas found.\n| After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned\nall items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis\nvia a property receipt.\nI was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden\nRoom, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a\nflat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and\nprinter; houever, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed\nfrom an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk\narea revealed no signs of any media devices.\nDet. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana\nroom, which is detached from the residence and located just south of\nthe pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office\ntype seting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,\nkeyboard, mouse and printer; houever, no CPU was located. All of the\ncables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A\nsearch of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.\no7/26/l7 Page 2o35 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032349.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 64\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\n\nDet. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the\n\nSouth East corner of the property. This area of this structure was\n\nassigned with single leters to identify a particular part of the\n\nroom. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a pouered\n\non Dell Dimension 235o, atached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The\n\nscreen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer brouser with URL\n\naddress of htp://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active\n\nwindous in the Start panel windou and photographed screen. The pouer\n\ncord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the\n\ncable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,\n\nmarked with Serial Number 6WTVN2l, was secured and turned over the\n\nevidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt.\n\nI also located several media related items within Room B, which were\nrecorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence\n\nCustodians.\n\nI then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a\n\nwhite in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer\n\ndesk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were pouered on.\n\nThe CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,\n\nwarning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active\n\nwindous in the Start panel windou and photographed screen. I removed\n\nthe pouer cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdoun all other\n\nmedia. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2oooo9lo78, was\n\nsecured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic\n\nanalysis via property receipt.
