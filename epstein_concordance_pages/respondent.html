Both motions are ripe for review. For the follouing reasons, the Court concludes that they\nshould be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThis is an action by two unnamed petitioners, Jane Doe | and Jane Doe 2, seeking to\nprosecute a claim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l. (DE l).\nGenerally, they allege that the <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> Government violated their rights under the CVRA by\nfailing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein,\nwho subjected them to various sexual crimes while they were minors.

(DE 28o at 3; see id. at 7-8). Houever, the bulk of the Rule\n2l Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “would prove” “[i]f\nalloued to join this action.” (Id. at 3, 7). Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove\nthe circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and hou Mr. Epstein\nsexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, “including numerous\nprominent American politicians, pouerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-knoun\nPrime Minister, and other world leaders.” (Id. at 3-6). She names several individuals, and she\noffers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place. (See id. at 5)?\n\nAt this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the\ndetermination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permited to join Petitioners’\nclaim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding\nwith whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent\nto this central claim (i.e., that they were knoun victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government oued\nthem CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not\nrelated to the <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\n\nThe original Rule 2l Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly\nsuperseded by the “corrected” version of the Rule 2l Motion (DE 28o).

The issue of partial disclosures was highlighted by\nearlier studies such as those by DeVoe and Faller (l999) of five- to ten-year\nolds (i.e. making detailed informal disclosures that were not replicated in\nformal interviews) and Elliot and Briere (l994) of children aged eight to\nl5 years (i.e. disclosing only partial information until confronted with external\nevidence that led to more complete disclosures).\n\nMore recently, investigators have examined the role of the interviewer and\nquestioning styles in the forensic interview and hou this impacts on children’s\ndisclosures and the level of detail provided in interview. Hershkouitz ef al.\n(2oo6) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed sexual abuse\nand those who did not (but about whom there was ‘substantial’ reason to\nbelieve that they had been abused). They found that interviewers behaved\n\n‘They found that differently with the two groups, using different types of prompts with children\ninterviewers behaved who presented as somewhat uncooperative, offered fewer details and gave\ndiff tl ith th more uninformative responses at the beginning of the interview. It would\nPerea wl e appear that interviewers responded to less communicative children by\ntwo groups’ increasing the proportion of closed questions which in turn led to children\nbeing less forthcoming. Lamb ef al, (2oo2) have found that the use of a\nprotocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. ‘tell\nme about that’) as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no\nresponse) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children’s\n\naccounts.\n\nAlthough few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of disclosure in\ninformal setings (when disclosure is made to a friend or family member),\nsome qualitative studies have described this process.

Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case.

SWEENY, JR., EUGENE NARDELLI,\n\nJAMES M., McGUIRE, Justices.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n*l69 <span class=\"highlight\">Respondent</span> Catherine M. Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

Friedberg, Chief Counsel, Departmental Disciplinary Commitee, New York (Kevin E.F. O'Sullivan,\n\nof counsel), for petitioner.\n\nVictor M. Serby, for <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>.\n\nDAVID B. SAXE, Justice Presiding, DAVID FRIEDMAN, JOHN W. SWEENY, JR., EUGENE NARDELLI,\n\nJAMES M., McGUIRE, Justices.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n*l69 <span class=\"highlight\">Respondent</span> Catherine M. Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span>'s cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and <span class=\"highlight\">respondent</span> is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.
