Overview\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed\nindictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from\na years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2oo2, the\ndefendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he\npaid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nHe undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in\nManhatan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the\n“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in\nsimilar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which\nwould be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and\nwould typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with\nvictims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate\n<span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>.\n\nMoreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional\ngirls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying\nthese victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this\nfashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations\nincluding New York and Palm Beach.\n\nThe defendant’s victims were as young as l4 years old when he abused them. Many of his\nvictims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant\nintentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his\nvictims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused\nthem.\n\nIn creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant\nworked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors\nby, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the\ndefendant, both in New York and in Florida.\n\nB. The Defendant\n\nJeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant\nand through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his\nrampant abuse of underage girls.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000356.jpg": "ate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 83\nime: l5:ol:37 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nise No, . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\n\nlo, 2oo6, at approximately 2:3o p.m., I served@llat her residence in\n\notiguipan The subpoena was given to her mother, Qi\n\nI learned through one of the victims Qj that she was personally\n\ncontacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein.\n\nThe source assured@™$she would receive monetary compensation for her\n\nassistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. @jfalso stated\n\nshe was told, \"Those who help him will be compensated and those who\n\nhurt him will be dealt with.” I told @lligthat tampering with a\n\nwitness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious.

Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000477.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 _ Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 6of 33 |\ntrust account to... , [an individual] who was also named as a potential co-conspirator.” Id. at l- |\n2.

By leter, dated July l6, 2ol9, Defense counsel states, among other things, that the Court\n\nshould reject the idea that “‘there’s literally nothing a person of Epstein’s means could say, do or |\npledge to rebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for release.” Dkt. 24 at 2.\n\n| “Epstein contends that § l59l and the concomitant remand presumption do not contemplate or\ncover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual massages for money.” Id. at l-2 n.l.\nDefense counsel also states that “Epstein certainly recognizes the Court’s request for further :\ntransparency and is commited to providing a complete and accurate disclosure. Accordingly,\nwe propose that the Court preliminarily accept the initial [financial] disclosure proffered last\nFriday and, if intending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Epstein to tender a\ncomprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as expeditiously as practicable.” Id. at 4. By\nleters, dated July l6 and July l7, 2ol9, Defense counsel also submited information regarding\nEpstein’s New Mexico sex offender registration status. Defense counsel also stated that Epstein\ntraveled extensively over the last eight months and “invariably returned to the to the United\nStates.

Ltr. at l, 3,\nshould be of litle comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to\nscrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal\nstandards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation.

Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 28o.\nThe court later struck the original motion, sealed the corrected motion, and ordered filing of a\nredacted version of the corrected motion. See id., Dkt.

A reasonable jury, after hearing the evidence,\ncould readily conclude that the natural meaning of those words in context is abundantly clear. For\ninstance, at the end of trial, a jury could conclude that “Jeffrey” is Jeffrey Epstein; “Jeffrey’s\nproperties” are Jeffrey Epstein’s properties, including his houses in Palm Beach, New York, New\nMexico, and the United States Virgin Islands (see, e.g., Ex. lo at 248:l7-2o (naming those\nproperties)); and “interact” is an expansive word aimed at capturing any <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>, that was used\nafter the defendant resisted words like “met,” “found,” and “hired” in the prior questions, see\nInteract, Oxford English Dictionary Online, htps://oed.com/view/Entry/975l8 (last visited\nFebruary 25, 2o2l) (“To act reciprocally, to act on each other.”).

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me.

The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). While the government’s effort to\nestablish the admissibility of such evidence in its opposition suffers from the same infirmities as\nits inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will respond\nto the government’s admissibility arguments more fully at the appropriate time.\n\nl. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in interstate and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d. J] l5-l6). As an overt\nact in furtherance of these conspiracies, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd. JJ lld, l7d (emphasis added). The\nIndictment further alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3. Jd. § 7c.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page6ofl4\n\nThe government does not and cannot dispute that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of\nconsent in England at all relevant times, and that it cannot establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\nsexual encounters with Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful. Nor can the\ngovernment dispute that the Indictment does not contain a single allegation that Ms. Maxwell,\nEpstein, or anyone else ever transported Accuser-3 or enticed her to travel—let alone with the\nintent that she engage in unlawful sexual activity. The Indictment offers no conceivable scenario\nin which Ms. Maxwell’s alleged encouragement of Accuser-3 to engage in lawful sexual activity\nwith Epstein in England “furthered” an alleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the\npurpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\n\nThe government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged interactions with\nAccuser-3 were “part of” such a conspiracy uses bizarre logic. See Opp. l6l. The government\ndoes not claim that any alleged interactions between Ms. Maxwell or Epstein and Accuser-3 in\nany way caused, or atempted to cause, any minor to travel, let alone for the purpose of the\nminor’s involvement in unlawful sexual activity. Instead, the government argues that because it\nhas alleged that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” two other minor individuals who traveled and engaged\nin illegal sex acts with Epstein, it somehou “follous” that encouraging an individual of legal age\nto engage in entirely lawful sexual activity with Epstetn—unaccompanied by any alleged travel\nor intended travel—was “part of” conspiracies to cause underage individuals to travel.

The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 4o of 349\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them.

According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home.

Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004526.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 229 of 349\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4526\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 8o\nphone calls were being recorded. Although he did not believe that Constand was making\nthese allegations in an atempt to get money from him, Cosby explained that, after\nConstand and her mother confronted him, he offered to pay for her education and asked\nhis atorney to commence discussions regarding seting up a trust for that purpose.\nCosby admited that it would be in his best interests if the public believed that Constand\nhad consented to the <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>, and that he believed he would suffer financial\nconsequences if the public believed that he had drugged and assaulted her.\n\nNotably, during his depositions, Cosby confessed that, in the past, he had provided\nQualudes®*—not Benadrylto other women with whom he wanted to have sexual\nintercourse.\n\nEventually, Constand setled her civil suit with Cosby for $3.38 million.’ Initially,\nthe terms of the setlement and the records of the case, including Cosby’s depositions,\nwere sealed.

He was succeeded as district\natorney by his former first assistant, Risa Vetri Ferman, Esquire.‘° Despite her\npredecessor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, upon release of the civil records, District\nAtorney Ferman reopened the criminal investigation of Constand’s allegations.

Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since Cosby previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that Cosby subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\nCosby could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d. Specifically, the court noted that Cosby was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay. This Court likewise rejected Cosby’s pre-trial efforts to appeal the\nadverse rulings, denying his petition for allouance of appeal, his petition for review, and\nhis emergency petition for a stay of the proceedings.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 32 of 8o\nselected from a different county. Thus, Cosby’s jury was selected from residents of\nAllegheny County, and trial commenced. On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\n<span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand. Again, Cosby opposed the motion. Follouing oral argument, and despite\nthere being no change in circumstances other than the first jury’s inability to reach a\nunanimous verdict, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion in part, increasing\nthe number of prior bad acts witnesses alloued at trial from one to five. The selection of\nthe five witnesses from a pool of at least nineteen women was left entirely to the\nCommonwealth.\n\nThe Commonwealth selected, and introduced testimony at Cosby’s second trial\nfrom, the follouing women:\n\nJanice Baker-Kinney. |n l982, Baker-Kinney worked at a Harrah’s Casino in\nReno, Nevada. During that year, a friend invited her to a party that, unbeknounst to her,\nwas being held at a temporary residence used by Cosby in Reno.

These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent.

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have.

(See Dkt. 35o.) The problems encountered by\nlegal mail delays continue. I have atempted to address this with MDC Legal via email (but at times\nreceive no response) and have conferred with government counsel. Only after two emails were sent\ntoday, the later informing MDC Legal that failure to respond would result in the filing of an order to\nshou cause, did I receive a response: “There was mail picked up today,” but no indication when Ms.\nMaxwell will receive the mail.\n\nLegal mail sent by counsel through the United States Postal Service for “next day delivery”\nremains at the post office for pick up by the MDC. The mail is not picked up daily, as evidenced by\ntracking information (most recently obtained this morning) and often remains at the Post Office for days\nbefore retrieved by the MDC. (See Exhibit A.) The Court invited the defense to bring this issue to the\nCourt’s atention if Ms. Maxwell does not receive mail within one business day of receipt. We are\nrequesting that the Court direct the MDC to retrieve the mail within one business day of receipt by the\npost office so that legal mail sent “next day delivery” does not languish in the post office for days on\nend.

The\ngovernment also represented for the first time that Accuser-3 is expected to testify that\nId. Accordingly, Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was a minor when she traveled or when she\nallegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the United States.\n\nDespite having been alerted to the problems with Accuser-3’s evidence, the government\nrepeated the same allegations related to Accuser-3 in the second superseding indictment filed\nafter the pretrial motions were fully briefed. See S2 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. l87) (“S2\nIndictment”) §f[ 9(c), l3(d), l9(d).

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page6ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 44 of 54\ndefendant has emphasized these witness statements, and claimed that they are exculpatory.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

In this article, | report\nthe results of searches using Google Scholar to look at the introduction of\nthis use of the term “grooming” to the peer-reviewed literature in l984 and\nits increasing use through 2ol6. Since 2oo8, the usage has been adopted\nin hundreds of articles in the professional literature each year, suggesting\nthat this usage of the term “grooming” will remain common in the decades\nahead. | also examine the history of the term “seduction” in the context of\nchild sexual abuse, particularly two archaic uses of the term: as a euphemism\nfor any sexual or sexually stimulating <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> between child and adult and\nin the context of suggestions that it was the child who seduced the adult.\nTo avoid resurrecting any confusion over these issues, it would be a mistake\nto abandon “grooming” in favor of “seduction.” | conclude that the best\nstrategy may be that adopted by Lanning of using the terms grooming and\nseduction in tandem, explaining the parallels between the seduction of one\nadult by another and the grooming or seduction of a child by an adult.\n'Park Dietz & Associates, Newport Beach, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPark Dietz, Park Dietz & Associates, Newport Beach, CA 92663, USA.\nEmall: expert@parkdletzassoclates.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006818.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “...

[Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006894.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 52\nreference their status positions, and the government has no evidence that she was not already\nwell-established friends of many years with both of the men. And even if she were trying to\ningratiate herself to a friend, so what? It has no bearing on the \"recruitment\" or \"grooming\" of\nminor females to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, as the Indictment charges.\n\nThe government contends that these Emails reveal \"defendant's intent and motive,\" but\ntheir argument is defies logic. If Ms. Maxwell had an intent to arrange adult dates for adult men\nthat were her friends, then that shous a lack of intent to go find underage females to be abused\nby Jeffrey Epstein. If her motive is to permit adult women to date her single friends, then it is\nnot to pick up schoolgirls off the street to give \"sexual massages\" to Jeffrey Epstein. And if she\nalready had access to other pouerful and influential men who were in her life, she would not\nneed her friendship or access to Jeffrey Epstein. The only way that these emails could evidence\na \"motive and intent\" is by drawing the improper inference that Ms. Maxwell has a propensity to\n\"facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like.\" This is exactly the\ntype of evidence forbidden by Rule 4o4(b).

But even if it is not, it is certainly admissible under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Direct Evidence\n\nAs the Government argued in its motion, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is direct\nevidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. The defendant’s conduct regarding Minor Victim-3\noverlaps in time and place with the other Minor Victims charged in the Mann Act conspiracies:\nCounts One and Three charge conduct from l994 to 2oo4 in New York and Palm Beach, and\nMinor Victim-3 began giving Epstein sexualized massages in l994, traveling to meet Epstein and\nthe defendant in both New York and Palm Beach. The Government expects the defendant’s\nrelationship with Epstein to be a “‘critical factual dispute’”— specifically, whether that relationship\nincluded conspiring with him and aiding or abeting Epstein’s sex crimes. United States v.\nRobinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol2). Minor Victim-3’s testimony will help establish that it\ndid.\n\nEvidence relating to Minor Victim-3 also “fills in a narrative” about “why [the defendant]\ntook actions to” arrange sexualized massages. United States v. Rodriguez, 727 F. App’x 24, 26\n(2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). Poe\nee\nee\na\n\nFinally, evidence related to Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence as corroboration for the other\nthree Minor Victims. Those Minor Victims will describe a conspiracy that operated to recruit girls\nfor the purposes of massage, groom them, and transform the massages into sexual encounters. The\nconspirators then traveled with the girls or invited girls to travel, and asked the girls to find others\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page7ofl3\nPage 7\nto engage in commercial sex acts, an element of the offense. The later is evidence that the\ndefendant and Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors, which requires that the minor victim\nbe under eighteen rather than seventeen. Minor Victim-3’s testimony will shou that she had sexual\nencounters with Epstein, and in combination with the testimony of other Minor Victims, the\nevidence will shou that Epstein continually sought out girls under the age of l8 for sex from l994\nthrough the time period of the sex trafficking conspiracy.”\n\nB. Rule 4o4(b)\n\nIn any event, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is relevant for multiple purposes that are\npermissible under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFirst, it is relevant to the defendant’s knouledge that the massages were sexualized, an\nissue that is expected to be central at this trial.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v.

Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l8 (l974)).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of Dr. Deitz and Dr. Loftus’s\nproposed testimony.\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo747l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 7 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico\n\nJane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any\nconstructive amendment argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,\nthe evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act\ncounts. (Tr. 3l49-5o; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.l (stating that the defense does “not contest that\nalleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]\nconspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knouledge that Epstein was\nhaving sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while\ntraveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating\nthe abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent\nwith the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive amendment.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.\nApp’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l); see Gross, 2o2l WL 4685ll, at *28 (noting that if the jury\ndetermined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different conspiracy, the jury\ninstructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other conspiracy”). Indeed, that\nevidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of\nAnnie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of\nenhancing the risk of conviction based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an\ninstruction, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to\nviolate New York law.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 24 of 49\nthat must be folloued,” but a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are\nselected to sit on this case, will you be able to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented at\nthe trial and in the context of the law as I will give it to you in my instructions, disregarding any\nother ideas, notions, or beliefs about the law that you may have encountered in reaching your\nverdict?” Id. at 43-44.\n\nWith respect to Juror 5o, the defendant has presented no evidence to support a claim of\nactual bias. In a public interview, Juror 5o stated that he “went into the trial firmly believing that\nMaxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye” and that\nhis oun experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until\nproven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex.

In fact, the conduct in the\n2ooos that Carolyn described was no different than the conduct in the l99os that Jane described.\nLike Carolyn, Jane testified that Epstein gave her money after almost every sexual <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>\nwith him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support a sex trafficking charge. (Tr. 3ol-\no2). Indeed, the government concedes that the only reason it did not expand Count Five to\ninclude Jane and Annie Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to include\nCarolyn’s abuse) was that the sex trafficking statute was not enacted until after their abuse had\noccurred. (Opp. at 28). Had that legal impediment not existed, the government could have, and\nno doubt would have, broadened the date range of Count Five to l994-2oo4, as it had done with\nCounts One and Three, and included overt acts related to Jane. Instead, the government included\na more narrou sex trafficking count based primarily on Carolyn’s allegations from 2ool-2oo4,\nbut still framed all of the charges in the Indictment as the product of a single, decade-long\nscheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to “groom” and recruit minor girls to be sexually\nabused at Epstein’s various residences from l994 to 2oo4. (See Ind. 4 l-2, Overview Section).\nAccordingly, the offenses charged in the Indictment support a finding of multiplicity.\n\nB. Overlap in Participants, Time, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government makes a half-hearted atempt to deny the obvious overlap between\nCounts Three and Five in participants, time period, and geographic scope. (Opp. at 3o-32). For\nexample, the government argues that some “but importantly, not all” of the participants in the\ntwo conspiracies overlapped, and notes that Sarah Kellen, who scheduled massage appointments\nfor Epstein in Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2ooos during the time period of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. (Opp. at 3o-3l).

She was\ngiven limited time to exercise in an area without sunlight or fresh air, then constructively denied\nthe ability to exercise because she was not provided proper-fiting footwear.\n\nThe treatment imposed on Ms. Maxwell was unnecessarily and intentionally degrading and\nthreatening. While in isolation, a high-ranking prison guard told Ms. Maxwell that there was\nconcern that she would be shot by sniper. Puting aside the reason and propriety of dispensing this\nalarming information, the diminution of security concerns resulting in her transfer to general\npopulation appears correlated to Ms. Maxwell having been sufficiently safeguarded to fill\nEpstein’s empty seat — satisfying the concerns of the government, DOJ, BOP, MDC, prosecutors,\nCourt, and accusers.\n\nDeprived of sleep and adequate nutrition and subjected to such undignified and\ndehumanizing conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell was considerably weakened psychologically\nand had great difficulty concentrating, thwarting her ability to participate in and prepare her\ndefense.

Maxwell’s victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who shoued\ninterest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme,\nand Epstein could not have commited these crimes without her.\n\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slouly broke doun their boundaries, and\nnormalized sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that the defendant shoued her hou Epstein\nliked to be massaged and hou he liked his penis touched. The defendant did this when Jane was\nonly l4 years old. The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual\nconduct with a young teenager. The defendant’s demeanor was “casual, like it was — like it was\nvery normal, like it was not a big deal.” (Tr. 3o9). When Jane was in her twenties, she described\nMaxwell this way to her boyfriend, who remembered years later hou Jane told him that Epstein\nhad abused her, and the defendant had made her feel comfortable. (Tr. 644).\n\nThe degree to which the defendant manipulated her victims is an aggravating factor in this\ncase. But her abusive conduct did not end with the grooming and manipulation of the victims.\nShe also participated in the sexual abuse of her victims. Not only was Maxwell the person who\nwas most frequently in the room when Epstein abused Jane (Tr. 289), but multiple victims testified\nthat the defendant groped their breasts. (Tr. 3lo (Jane), 2224 (Annie), l536 (Carolyn)). In\nparticular, Annie described a terrifying <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> in which she found herself alone with Maxwell\nat Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, and Maxwell told her to remove her clothing so she could give\nAnnie a “massage” during which she rubbed Annie’s breasts. (Tr. 2224; PSR 4 52).

The S2 indictment, paragraph\n9(b), claims that “Maxwell interacted with [Accuser-2] on at least one occasion in or about l996\nat Epstein’s residence in New Mexico....” The journal references other dates, places, and events\nin l996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell in context with other recorded events is\nboth relevant and exculpatory.\n\nAs a piece of physical evidence, the journal is subject to inspection and testing. See F. R.\nCrim. P. l7(c)(l). Moreover, were the journal in the possession of the government it would be\nsubject to inspection under F. R. Crim. P. l6 (a) (l) (E) which provides, in relevant part:\n\nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to\ninspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data,\nphotographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of\nany of these items, if the tem is within the government's possession,\ncustody, or control and:\n\n(i) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial[.]\n\nTo avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted partisan\nphotocopies of five substantive pages without questioning the provenance of an exhibit it intends\nto introduce at trial.

The Court Should Preclude Testimony by Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly\nBovino About Sexualized Massages with Jane\n\nIt appears that the defendant seeks to offer testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\nKelly Bovino that they did not participate in sexualized massages with Jane. This testimony would\nnot contradict Jane’s testimony at all. But even if it did, such contradiction is impeachment about\na collateral mater through extrinsic evidence, and it is impeachment of supposedly contradictory\nstatements made on cross examination, rather than on direct examination, each of which renders\nimpeachment improper. Such testimony should be precluded.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense asked Jane a series of questions about what she had told\nthe Government about other participants in group sexual encounters with Epstein and the\ndefendant. Tr. 523-24. In the course of that testimony, Jane confirmed that she “told the\nGovernment” there was “a woman named Eva” who “joined in” with another woman. Tr. 525-26.\nShe also “remembered” another participant “named Michelle,” who was “short.” Tr. 526-27. And\nfinally, Jane “remembered” a participant “name Kelly,” whose last name Jane also “remembered,”\nand who Jane thought was “‘a model who was older than [Jane].” Tr. 527.\n\nDefense counsel confirmed that Jane told the Government that Jane thought she could\nrecognize photos of at least a few of the participants, but the Government had not shoun her photos\nof Eva, Michelle, or Kelly. Tr. 527, 53o. Despite this line of questioning, defense counsel did not\nshou Jane photos on the stand or ask Jane for last names of any of these individuals or any other\nidentifying information.\n\nB. Discussion\nThe Government expects that the defendant plans to call Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl2\nshe did not engage in sexualized massages with Jane therefore in no way contradicts Jane’s\ntestimony.\n\nSimilarly, atempting to identify Michelle Healy as the “Michelle” Jane mentioned lacks a\nbasis in the record. Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for identification as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none identified with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in connection with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva Dubin. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva Dubin] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember DUBIN being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If Dubin, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl5\nthat this entry and the\nprior entry reference\ndifferent visits,\nalthough the defense\nconflated them on\ncross examination.\n\nfirst paragraph | in’ and started taking her clothes counsel did not shou\noff.

A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.

The constitutional backdrop.\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v. Van\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 68o (l986) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l8 (l974)). “Cross-\nexamination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of [her]\ntestimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. The importance of cross-examination cannot be\noverstated where, as here, the government’s proof depends almost entirely on the uncorroborated\ntestimony of the accusers. Poventud v.

These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020739.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel2l of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l87 Filed o3/29/2l Page 4 of 24 |\n|\nindebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to |\nhelp them.\ne.

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude.

Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them.

According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed ina school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment.

Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home.

In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021317.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l43 3536o38, Pagel45 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff?s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span>, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!®° At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021402.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 358 3536o38, Page23o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7**\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafaia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate... all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “‘as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024094.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nClinical <span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span>\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\n<span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span> Date: o7/3o/2ol9 l5:58 Provider: po a Unit: Zol\nChronic Care - Chronic Care Clinic <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> performed at Health Services.\nSUBJECTIVE:\nCOMPLAINT l Provider: POO “o\nChief Complaint: Other Problem\nSubjective: PATIENT WAS REFERRED BY THE WARDEN FOR EVALUATION.\nPATIENT REPORTS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT HIS MEDS FOR ABOUT l WEEK.

Follouing that, he held a\nnumber of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at\nBear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknoun policy violations in l98l. He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant with in the late l98os.\" was described as his\nfirst mentor. }°°\"°\"\"\" twas later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years later | Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as\" O\"™\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo252l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025282.jpg": "Page lo59 = = =\ny , Bureau of Prisons\n_— Health Services\nClinical <span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span>\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M___Race- WHITE Facility; NYM\n<span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span> Date: o7/23/2ol9 o6:2o Provider: MLP Unit: _HOl\nInjury Assessment - Non-work related <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> performed at Health Services. ,\nSUBJECTIVE:\nINJURY l Provider: MLP\nDate of Injury: o7/23/2ol9 ol:27 Date Reported for Treatment: o7/23/2ol9 o8:25\nWork Related: No Work Assignment: UNASSG\nPain Location:\nPain Scale: o\nPain Qualities:\nWhere Did Injury Happen (Be specific as to location):\nSpecial Housing Unit Zo5-Cell l24 L\nCause of Injury (Inmate's Statement of hou injury occurred):\ned\nSymptoms (as reported by inmate):\nNone\nOBJECTIVE:\nTemperature:\no7/23/2ol9 o6:3o NYM 97.5 36.4 Oral Pea MiP\nPulse:\no7/23/2ol9 o6:3o 92 Via Machine Regular MLP\nRespirations:\nDate Time Rate Per Minute Provider\no7/23/2ol9 o6:3o NYM l6 SO P\nBlood Pressure: :\no7/23/2ol9 o6:3o NYM l4o/85  RightArm _ Siting Adult-regulal\" °° |MLP\nSaO2:\nDate Time Value(%) Air Provider\no7/23/2ol9 o6:3o NYM 96 Room Air ee LP\nExam:\nGeneral\nAffect\nYes: Cooperative\nAppearance\nYes: Appears Well, Alert and Oriented x 3\nNo: Appears Distressed, Lethargic, Dyspneic, Appears in Pain, Pallor, Cyanotic, Diaphoretic, Disheveled,\nGenerated o7/23/2ol9 o9:o5 A Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025283.jpg": "Page lo6o em ;\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD ° Reg#: 763l8-o54\n: Date of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: © M_ Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\n<span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span> Date: o7/23/2ol9 o6:2o Provider: MLP Unit: —-HOl\nExam: |\nAcutely Ill\nPulmonary\nAuscultation\nYes: Clear to Auscultation, Vesicular Breath Sounds Bilaterally\nNo: Crackles, Rhonchi, Wheezing\nExam Comments\nASSESSMENT:\nInjury, unspecified, Tl49o - Current - R/O seff inflicted injuries.\nPLAN:\nDisposition:\nFollou-up at Sick Call as Needed\nPlaced on Suicide Watch\nFollou-up in 2-4 Hours\nOther:\nFor follou up with psychology service. ,\nPatient Education Topics:\no7/23/2ol9 Counseling Access to Care BY): (ONPG) Verbalizes\nUnderstanding\no7/23/2ol9 Counseling Plan of Care Verbalizes\nUnderstanding\nCopay Required: No Cosign Required: Yes\nTelephone/Verbal Order: No\nCompleted by\" _ LP on o7/23/2ol9 o9:o5\nRequested to be cosigned by ce |\nCosign documentation will be displayed on the follouing page.\nGenerated o7/23/2ol9 o9:o5 we Bureau of Prisons - NYM .

Follouing that, he held a\nnumber of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at\nBear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknoun policy violations in l98l. He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant wit the late l98os. pee age described as his\nfirst mentor. as later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years later Or Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027343.jpg": "DNR order —Yes ———-—_ _¥_No\nDate\nAdvance Directive / Living Will SS, ne 2\nDate\nREVIEW OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE:\nWas death related to a medical emergency _¥_Yes ___No\nResponse to medical emergency\nnotification timely _v¥_Yes ___No __NA\nPhysician /_Yes No NA\nPhysician Assistant —___No _¥_NA\nNurse Practitioner No v¥_NA\nNurse(s) _v_Yes —_.No __NA\nEmergency Medical Techs ___Yes —_No _¥_NA\nOthers —___Yes\n——_Yes\nCPR _v_Yes ___No —__NA\nACLS List protocol (s) used (if appropriate) _Y_Yes ___No ——NA\nBy EMS.\nProblems encountered during medical emergency, e.g., Yes _¥__No —NA\nequipment, communications, transportation.\nDescribe briefly:\nProviders responding maintain current certification / credentials in _v_Yes ——No —NA\nBCLS, ACLS (if required)\nSUMMARY REVIEW:\nPDF Prescribed by P6ol3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027354.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nClinical <span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span>\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg#: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\n<span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span> Date: o7/24/2ol9 l3:o8 Provider: eel i LP Unit: HOl\nMid Level Provider - Follou up Visit <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> performed at Receiving & Discharge.\nSUBJECTIVE:\nCOMPLAINT l4 Provider: pees LP\nChief Complaint: Other Problem\nPain: No\neee\nOBJECTIVE:\nTemperature:\no7/24/2ol9 l3:l2 NYM 97.8 36.6 Oral ‘eae ao\nPulse:\no7/24/2ol9 l3:l2 83 Via Machine Regular Peer Le\nBlood Pressure:\nDate Time Value _— Location Position Cuff Size Provider\no7/24/2ol9 l3:l2NYM l32/89 — Right Arm Siting Adult-regulafh | MLP\n$ao2:\no7/24/2ol9 l3:l2 NYM 96 Room Air MLP\nExam:\nGeneral\nAffect\nYes: Cooperative\nAppearance\nYes: Appears Well, Alert and Oriented x 3\nNo: Appears Distressed, Appears in Pain\nExam Comments\nFollou up evaluation done for inmate Epstein.\nHe does not look in any pain or distress.\nGT\nASSESSMENT:\nInjury, unspecified, Tl49o - Current\nPLAN:\nDisposition:\nGenerated o7/24/2ol9 l3:24 py OC Ip Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027355.jpg": "sj\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: o4/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\n<span class=\"highlight\">Encounter</span> Date: o7/24/2ol9 l3:o8 Provider: pee LP Unit: —-_HOl\n2\nFollou-up at Sick Call as Needed\nPatient Education Topics:\nDate Initiated Format Handout/Topic Provider Outcome\no7/24/2ol9 Counseling Access to Care LONG), (OMT NC) Verbalizes\nUnderstanding\no7/24/2ol9 Counseling Preventive Health Verbalizes\nUnderstanding\nCopay Required: No Cosign Required: Yes\nTelephone/Verbal Order: No\nCompleted byf®@ © |MLP on o7/24/2ol9 l3:24\nRequested to be cosigned by PRE Mp.\nCosign documentation will be displayed on the follouing page.\nGenerated o7/24/2ol9 l3:24 by!

This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\nDs It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment,\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s\ncircumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be\ndeposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued\n\non good cause shoun.”\n\nfA This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal\ncase from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d l338 (Fla. l993); State v.\nTarrago, 8oo So.2d 3oo (Fla. 3d DCA 2ool).

Alessi stated\nhe was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately l993 through 2oo4. Alessi stated he\nwas the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for\nEpstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private\nplane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein\nreceives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that touards\nthe end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi\nstated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's\nbedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things\ngoing on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times touards the end of his employment that he\nwould have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.\n\nOn January 4, 2oo6 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn\ntaped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from\nNovember 2oo4 through May of 2oo5. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler,\nchauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about\nmasseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have\none massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated\nhe would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would\nmeet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allou them entry into the kitchen\narea and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or\nEpstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses\nappeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses.\nHe stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for\none of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high\nschool age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.\nHe would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators\nand sex toys scatered on the floor. He also said he would wipe doun the vibrators and sex toys and put them\naway in an armoire.

On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl\nhe brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the\ngirl always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents,\nand a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High\nSchool after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and\ndirection to extend the rental contract.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records\nfrom several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen.

While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master\nbedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\nhouse. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a\nduplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is writen into the book, the top copy is then torn\non the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers\nwere on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been\ninterviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of \"work.\" Other\nnames and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, \"I have girls for him\" or \"I\nhave 2 girls for him.\" These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the botom of the messages.\nDuring the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s\nbedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside\nEpstein’s bed that contained a botle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located\nwhich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed\nwhich shoued several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these\nimages appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.\n\nOn December l3, 2oo5, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob o2/29/l988. During a sworn taped\nstatement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein’s house to provide a massage\nfor money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2oo4) when an associate, YL, approached her and\nasked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove\nML to the house to “work.” They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to\nremember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led\nupstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the\nlotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and\nbathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large\nspacious bathroom with a steam room and shouer beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the\nphone when she entered the room.

He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The\ngirls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage.\n\nOn November 2l, 2oo5 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated\nhe was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately l993 through 2oo4. Alessi stated he\nwas the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for\nEpstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private\nplane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein\nreceives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that touards\nthe end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi\nstated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's\nbedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things\ngoing on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times touards the end of his employment that he\nwould have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. .\n\nOn January 4, 2oo6 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn\ntaped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from\nNovember 2oo4 through May of 2oo5. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler,\n\n- chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about\nmasseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have |\none massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated |\nhe would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would\nmeet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allou them entry into the kitchen\narea and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or\nEpstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses |\nappeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses.\n\nHe stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for\none of the girls that came to provide a massage.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\nhtn-/ww_orinthi s.clickahilitv eomivalent antennae Pena That Pantaciee de Reco Request Noy A aeRRe\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031424.jpg": "Mate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 57\nStine: l57ol5 37 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\ntase Nou « = « & E-o5-ooo368 (Cont inued)\nFronstin had telephoned her reference this case.

She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\nof the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.\nAlessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance\nperson. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s\n‘arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they\ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing\nwith his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with\nEpstein directly.\nI asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.\nAlessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each\nmasseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger.

Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\n5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, :\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the\nhtn://www.printhis.clickabilitv.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 26 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032067.jpg": "The Fantasist raye oui 7\nNext: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong.\nThe police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgar and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to <span class=\"highlight\">encounter</span> the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\n4 Yentord = |\nhtn:/hanans meinthic clickahility eam/nt/ent?action=ent&tle=ThetFantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 28 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032118.jpg": "Be ers ad Fouce mtervieweu Uve allegeu ULUCIdId disU Wauicu Ww Lilla xo KUL\nBeni -. victims and l7 witnesses.

I brought Mr. Rodriguez to the interview room.\no7/26/l7 Page 2592 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo329o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032906.jpg": "ate: 4/2o/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: a\nime: l3:o2:26 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nDuring a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed ,\nby Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by\nassociates and his employment lasted the months of November 2oo4\nthrough May 2oo5. His responsibilities as house manager included\nbeing the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.\nEpstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had\nvery limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a\nmessage to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary\n\"Leslie\" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal\nassistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez\nstated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in\nresidence.\nI asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in\nPalm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked\nspecifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he\nwould have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the\nmorning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.\nRodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them\ncomfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them.\nRodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allou them\nentry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.\nThey would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They\nwould be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if\nany of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask\ntheir ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate\nlike his oun daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they\nwould eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez\nstated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be\nMasseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered\na dozen roses to RM \"igh school for one of the girls\nthat came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high\nschool and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the\nmassages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.\nHe would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and\nwould discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scatered on the floor.\nHe also said he would wipe doun the vibrators and sex toys and put\nthem away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood\narmoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.\nEpstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a\ncar for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive\nher self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl\nalways needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself\nas a “human ATM machine\" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a\nminimum balance of $2,ooo dollars on him at all times. When a girl\nwould come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or\nwas not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl\n(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify\nEpstein the amount they were given.
