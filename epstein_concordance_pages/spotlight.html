Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v. Bodmer, No. o3-cr-947(SAS), 2oo4 WL l6979o, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y.\n\nJan. 28. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29 (D.D.C. 2oo4); United States v.\nKashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989).\n\nFinally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-l9 pandemic would\npose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to\n2 The media. <span class=\"highlight\">spotlight</span> has dlso drawa.ou! people whe claim te speak foros.

Ms. Maxwell is not trying to hide anything from the government.\nShe has been entirely transparent with her finances and has filed accurate and timely joint\ntax returns with her spouse for the last four years, and she has put it all at risk of forfeiture if\nshe flees under the proposed bail package. The Macalvins report and the report of 7\nmm give the Court a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances. Accordingly, the Court\nshould have no pause about granting her on bail on the proposed terms.\n\nC. Ms. Maxwell Was Not Hiding from the Government Before Her Arrest\n\nl. Ms. Maxwell Was Trying to Protect Herself hs from a\nMedia Frenzy and from Physical Threats\n\nThe leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse also forcefully debunks the fiction that Ms.\nMaxwell was trying to conceal her whereabouts from the government before her arrest, as\nthe government argued at the first bail hearing. (Tr. 25). Ms. Maxwell made efforts to\nremove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into\nher personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, hy from third parties\nwho threatened violence. To suggest that she was a fugitive is patently wrong.\n\nAfter Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in BOP custody, the media coverage of\nMs. Maxwell spiked dramatically, as the press rushed to substitute Ms. Maxwell for Epstein\nas the target of the scandal.
