Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in\nsexual activities in Mr. Epstein’s Palm Beach house?\nA. No, not that I recall.\n\nI i \"< faye asked the flouing\nquestion:\n\nQ. Do you knou whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or devices\nused in sexual activities?\nA. No.\n\nThe defendant nou argues that these questions are ambiguous because they contain\n“numerous undefined terms,” such as “sex toy or device” and “sexual activities.” (Def. Mot. 4 at\nl4). She asks, for instance, whether “bath oil” would count as a sex toy or device. (/d.). Yet this\nargument is simply another atempt to imbue ambiguity after the fact into commonly used words\nwith common sense meanings. The mere fact that a term could apply equally to several different\nobjects does not automatically mean that the question is impermissibly vague and can never form\nthe basis of a perjury charge.

The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nBinds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.\n\nEmbedded within Annabi’s canon of construction that prosecutors in one\ndistrict cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must\nbe a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention. Thus, if \"it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction,\"\nAnnabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.\nl986).\n\nThe language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which\n(l) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (Al78), (2)\ncontains a structural <span class=\"highlight\">separation</span> of this clause from the more restrictive language used\nelsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global”\nagreement. Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators\neasily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language. No\nsuch language was utilized and was, in fact, removed from the co-conspirator clause.\n\nA promise to bind other districts can be inferred from negotiations between a\ndefendant and a prosecutor.

The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's <span class=\"highlight\">separation</span> and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide Prevention\nThe BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous observation.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023734.jpg": "Epstein, Jeffrey 763l8-o54 BP-Ao2o3\n\nTo Shirley V.
