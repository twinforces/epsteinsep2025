Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel.

INOW LUVIN L USL augye «evar\nOne pouer player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump.\n\"I've knoun Jeffrey for l5 years,\" The Donald tells the magazine. \"Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is\neven said that he likes beautiful women as much as | do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\nAnother thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a\ntaste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,ooo-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 7lst Street.\nLeslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in l989 for $l5,ooo.\nEpstein's mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $l.\nEpstein quickly spent $lo million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.\n\"| don't want to live in another person's house,” Epstein told New York.\nBlind dater\nCHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The \"Law & Order\" hunk was set up on a blind date with\nRose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at\nthe Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the\nset of \"Sex and the City.\" MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson.\n‘Rockets’ soars\n\"ROCKETS Redglare!\" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and dountoun icon - won the Grand\nJury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by\nLuis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets’ pals Willem Dafoe, Mat Dillon, Jim\nJarmusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 35o-pound former bodyguard of punk\nlegend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of Buscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of\ndrug abuse.\nBizarre union\nBOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. \"He treated women like the rest of the\nworld treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?\" she told \"2o/2o\" contributing correspondent\nChris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and\nvideotape, Pat insists: \"We had a <span class=\"highlight\">wonderful</span> sex life. We had a <span class=\"highlight\">wonderful</span> marriage.” Crane was bludgeoned to\ndeath in l978 with a camera tripod.\nPlot device\nGAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel \"The\nNight We Met,\" a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Byrnes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After\nmaking references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Byrnes even atempts to replicate one of our\nitems in the climax. Byrnes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does\nhave us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece.\nChange partners\nSOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for\nman-about-toun Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in\nflagrante with a l9-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a\nnew man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he\nneeded to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these\ndays.\nWell protected\n. Py i‘ =\nhtp://pgash.pqarchiver.com/nypost/22249393 l hyn?
