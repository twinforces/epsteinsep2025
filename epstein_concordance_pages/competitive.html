At no point did the\ndefendant seek relief from the protective order. Id. When the other party to the protective order |\nlearned of the defendant’s blatant disregard of its obligations, it moved for sanctions in the civil |\naction. Id.\nThe district court condemned the defendant’s behavior as “entirely unnecessary and |\ninappropriate,” but nonetheless refused to sanction the defendant—apparently because, had the |\ndefendant sought relief from that order, the judge would have granted its request. Jd. at 93-94, |\nWhile the Martindell factors were never mentioned expressly by the district court, Judge |\nBroderick observed that the confidentiality order did not implicate “technological trade secrets, |\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive <span class=\"highlight\">competitive</span> information which |\ncould benefit rivals”—factors that, if present, he would have had more difficulty balancing |\nagainst the investigative needs of law enforcement. Id. at 94. |\nThere are three reasons why Chemical Bank does not justify this Court’s refusing to |\napply the Martindell factors to the Government’s application. First and foremost, the opinion of ,\nanother district judge does not trump an opinion from the Second Circuit. Second, while a reader |\nof Chemical Bank cannot be certain whether the district court complied with Martindell, the |\n|\nlanguage quoted above certainly suggests that the district court engaged in the balancing exercise |\nthat Martindell contemplated. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the Government’s |\ninvestigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I will return later |\nin this opinion. |\nThe Court will, therefore, analyze the Government’s request in light of the Martindell |\nfactors. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo886 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4936 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 3\nOutpatient Eating Disorders Research Group, Butler Hospital, Providence, RI\nlo/89 -

The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry.
