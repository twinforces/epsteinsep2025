Jeffrey Epstein, Criminal No. l9-49o\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nWe write to outline the grounds entitling Jeffrey Epstein to pretrial release, proposing a\nstringent set of conditions that will effectively guarantee his appearance and abate any\nconceivable danger he’s claimed to present.\n\nIn essence, the government seeks to remand a self-made New York native and lifelong\nAmerican resident based on dated allegations for which he was already convicted and punished —\nconduct the relitigation of which is barred by a prior federal nonprosecution agreement (the\n“NPA”). The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once\natempted to flee the United States — despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could\nvoid the NPA in appropriate circumstances, possibly threatening new charges there, and\nnotwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein\nwas subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one\nspecifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to\ntry and end-run the NPA -— yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to\nvindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense. Finally,\nthe government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect compliance with\nonerous sex offender registration requirements — pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts —\nacross multiple jurisdictions over a lo-year period.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000276.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 3 of l6\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl. Home detention in Mr. Epstein’s Manhatan residence, with permission to leave only for\nmedical appointments as approved by Pretrial Services, including (at the Court’s\ndiscretion) the installation of surveillance cameras at the front and rear entrances to\nensure compliance.\n\n2.

Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F.

At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\ncommunity’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 36l-lo (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction\ncharges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted]. We will need to interview her to confirm\nthe accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 36l-ll (prosecutor stating, “I knou that someone\nmentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual\nbasis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 36l-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t knou the\nfactual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that’). In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000280.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6- Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 7 of l6\nthat was unsealed and became public in July 2ol3, specifically noted that “a number of districts\noutside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern District of New York and the District\nof New Jersey) share <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and venue with the Southern District of Florida over potential\nfederal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual acts commited by Epstein against the\nPetitioners.

The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions. See id. at lo n.9.\n\nThe defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and\nexecute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two\nvenues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication)\noccurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same\nprosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of\nwhat in fact was a single criminal transaction. What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest. During that time, as noted by the\ngovernment, he engaged in substantial international travel, always returning to his residences in\nthe United States. Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee. This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions\nregarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges\npending against him.\n\nOn September 24, 2oo7, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice,\nthrough the United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), entered\ninto the NPA with Mr. Epstein. The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential\nfederal charges that “may have been commited by Epstein . . . from in or around 2ool through\nin or around September 2oo7.” Exhibit l, NPA, at l-2. One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added).

Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000335.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 7 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug.\n3, 2ol5); United States v. Young, Nos. l2 Cr. 5o2, l2 Cr. 645, 2ol3 WL l2l3l3oo, at *7 (D. Utah\nAug. 27, 2ol3); United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547, 2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D.\nCal.

Botero, 6o4 F. Supp. lo28, lo35 (S.D. Fla. l985). . The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000337.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 9 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s}uch a conclusion would, in fact,\ndemand a defendant's detention’”)).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”\nas “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 (“although this Defendant has vast\nfinancial resources to construct his oun ‘private prison,’ the Court is not convinced ‘disparate\ntreatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act’”) (quoting United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000340.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l2 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000373.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document l4 Filed o7/l5/l9 Page 8 of l8 |\n| | SORA HEARING page7\n‘oS l a He is registered in the U.S. Virgin Islands, he )\n| . | 2 has been since his release from jail.

Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\nRespectfully submited,\nGEOFFREY S.

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

Defendant’s Proposed Bail Package\n\nHaving determined that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk (and also a danger to the community),\nthe Court next examines the Defendant’s proposed bail package.

This is not the Court’s function. See\nUnited States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6) (“The [bail |\npackage] . . . proposed by the defense is not reasonable because, in too many respects, it |\nsubstitutes judicial oversight and management for (more appropriate) reliance upon trained,\nexperienced, and qualified professionals from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals |\nService.”). The Defense package components would embroil the Court in issues, among others, |\nrelating to the level of force that may be used to secure the Defendant, who may enter the |\nresidence, daily reporting by Mr. Epstein, and reporting by so-called Trustee(s) designated to live |\nwith and supervise Mr. Epstein. See United States v. Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d 283, 295 (E.D.N.Y. |\n2ol4) (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use force |\nagainst defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether the\nguards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties - indeed, the\nimperfections - of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.’’).\n(3) The Defense proposal to give advance consent to extradition and waiver of extradition\nrights is, in the Court’s view, an empty gesture. And, it comes into pay only after Mr. Epstein has |\nfled the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. According to the Government, “The Department of Justice’s Office |\nof International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an |\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a |\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.” Dkt. ll at 7. |\n(4) Although the Defense has stated that Mr. Epstein would be agreeable to puting up :\n“any amount” of collateral or signing “any bond” the Court would require, there has, to date, |\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo5ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000518.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 8 of 74 8\n\nl legal or administrative proceedings in Florida, the Virgin\n\n2 Islands, New Mexico, and any other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> comparable to\n\n3 the one before Judge Pickholz in which she ruled on l-l8-2oll.\n4 So I'm not suggesting that there are, although I think\n5 I did read someplace that there may be some proceeding pending\n6 in New Mexico.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000764.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\n\nHon.

Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

No such |\nmaterials have been received by the Court as of this date.\nThe Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin\nIslands (Level I) and in Florida (Level J).

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

The Defense package components would embroil the Court in issues, among others, |\nrelating to the level of force that may be used to secure the Defendant, who may enter the |\nresidence, daily reporting by Mr. Epstein, and reporting by so-called Trustee(s) designated to live |\nwith and supervise Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France.

The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001164.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck A Ob 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required.

The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001244.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOoo88oHAEN Add uUMeht /LOF l FileadsasO9F2Ag ePage?lGhe\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have <span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool244\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001245.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOooB8BoHAEN Add uUMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePage@BlGho\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001247.jpg": "Caseel24 o/o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001251.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BoHAEN 2ADetuMhent ‘LOZ l Filecgsas/O9F2ig eP aged l6h\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV.

(Dkt. l65 at 2-3). It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it\ncreated this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a\nnotice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion.

Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in\nthe opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (atached as Exhibit A), the\ngovernment’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the follouing reasons:\n\n= The government’s argument goes against the leter of the law.\n= The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law.\n= The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law.\n(Julie Opinion {ff 6-26).\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001261.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiKRGS3S2e/Raghageor 6648\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001269.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/oo8BQlAU At DOMED l/2o 2 Filedees/2G/PIagPage 45l65l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Nathan, Judge).\n\nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,\nADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the motion to consolidate is DENIED and the appeal is\nDISMISSED for want of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.\n\nDefendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks interlocutory relief from a September 2, 2o2o\ndenial of her motion to modify a protective order entered on July 3o, 2o2o. In the alternative, she\nargues that this Court should issue a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to modify the\nprotective order. She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Gzuffre\nv. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Meanwhile, the Government moves this Court to dismiss the appeal for\nlack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and opposes Maxwell’s motion to consolidate on the grounds that the issues\npresented on appeal are both factually and legally distinct. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the\nunderlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\nThis Court has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.”\nCobbledick v. United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc, 5ll U.S. 863, 867—\n68 (l994) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). The Supreme Court has described the\n“conditions for collateral order appeal as seringenf’ in general, Digital Equip. Corp., 5ll US. at 868\n(emphasis added), and, with respect to criminal cases, it has “interpreted the collateral order\nexception with the wimost strictness.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (l989)\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited). To fall within this limited category of\nappealable collateral orders, a decision must “(l) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2)\nresolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The\ncriminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002007.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 35 of 45\n\nMr. Julie opines that the French entity with <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over the legality of extradition\nrequests would not oppose Ms. Maxwell’s extradition on the ground that she is a French citizen,\nand that it is “highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree” against her. (/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (l) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (i) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (ll) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States; (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that [Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (Ud. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her rights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries.*\n\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French\nauthorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell.

The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”.

Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it\nis highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors, namely: her\nUnited States citizenship; the fact that she has signed an irrevocable Waiver in the USA;\nthe fact that in the present situation, the only way the issue would be raised in France is\nif Ms. Maxwell would have already fled to France in violation of very strict bail\nconditions, and the fact that a failure by French authorities to grant extradition would\nresult in an obligation to try Ms. Maxwell before French courts for the conduct described\nin the Indictment. Finally, France would be inclined to preserving the interests of the\nUSA for obvious diplomatic reasons.\n\ne With regard to timing, if the requested person has consented to extradition, the\nInvestigating Chamber must deliver its ruling no later than l4 working days after the\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 8 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nsupervision, or under house arrest with electronic surveillance) or incarceration at\nthe remand prison of the Court of appeal in which <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> he/she has been\napprehended.\n\n- The decision of the l“ President of the Court of Appeal can be challenged before\nthe Investigating Chamber of the Court of Appeal.\n\n- Incase of incarceration, the requested person can file an application for release\nbefore the Investigating Chamber of the Court of appeal at any time during the\nextradition procedure.\n\n9. Under Article l3.4 of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, if, within 6o\ndays of arrest, the government of the requested State has not received from the requesting\nState the formal extradition request as well as supporting documents required by the\nTreaty’, the requested person is discharged from custody. If the government has received\nthe relevant documents, the normal extradition procedure may begin.\n\nlo. If the person has been discharged from custody pursuant to Article l3.4 of the Treaty,\nsuch release does not preclude a subsequent re-arrest if an extradition request and\nsupporting documents are delivered at a later date (Article l3.5).\n\nB. Second stage: Application for extradition (Ministerial phase)\n\nll. Article lo.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France provides that “all\nrequests for extradition shall be submited through the diplomatic channel”.\n\nl2. The Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not specify which internal\nprocedures must be folloued in each contracting State follouing the transmission of the\nextradition request through the diplomatic channel pursuant to Article lo. We must\ntherefore refer to provisions of the French Code of Criminal Procedure to outline the\nprocedure folloued by French institutions upon receipt of an extradition request made\nby the USA.\n\nl3. Under Article 696-9 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, the procedure folloued\nin France is as follous:\n\n7 Article lo of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 7\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l9 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n57. If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought, Article\n3(2) requires the requested State to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if\nso requested by the requesting State.\n\n58. Consequently, the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not\ncontain any prohibition on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it merely states that\nthere is no obligation upon the requested State to grant the extradition of a person who\nis one of its nationals.\n\n59. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA must therefore be distinguished\nfrom several international agreements on extradition ratified by France, which, by\ncontrast, contain a clear rule against the extradition of French citizens*?.\n\n6o. For example, France has made the follouing declaration pursuant to Article 6 of the\nEuropean Convention on Extradition l957, which gives Contracting States “the right to\nrefuse extradition of nationals”:\n\n“Extradition shall be refused when the person sought had French nationality at the time\nof the alleged offence’.\n\n6l. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European Convention on\nExtradition”.\n\n62. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA is similar to other international\nagreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against the\nextradition of nationals. These are generally treaties signed with Common law\njurisdictions, which do not oppose the extradition of their nationals*’.\n\n3° See, for example, the Extradition treaty between France and Morocco, or the Extradition treaty between France\nand China.\n3! See France’s instrument of ratification of the European Convention on Extradition, deposited on lo February\nl986.\n32 The European Convention on Extradition l957 is an instrument of the Council of Europe which was signed in\nParis on December l3, l957 and came into force on April l8\", l96o. The European Convention on Extradition\nis open to signature by non-Council of Europe States, as such it was ratified by South Africa, Israel, and the\nRepublic of Korea. It was ratified by France on February lo\", l986.\n33 For example, the Extradition Treaty between France and Canada, signed in Otawa on l7 November l988,\ncontains a similar provision to the United States Treaty: “The requested State shall not be bound to extradite its\noun nationals.

The wording of these international agreements, which do not contain a prohibition on\nthe extradition of nationals, raises some important questions. In particular, could France\ndecide to extradite its nationals on the basis of these international agreements without\nviolating applicable international law, European law, or French constitutional law?\n\n64. In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus necessary to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) applicable international law, (i) European law, and (i) French\nconstitutional law.\n\n7) International law\n\n65. As outlined, international treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the principle constitutional status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the principle in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under international\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European Convention on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n69. Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l8 of 36\ndemonstrated ability to live in hiding—numerous courts have recognized that purported waivers\nof extradition are unenforceable and effectively meaningless.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v.

The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 22 of 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever.

Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 22\nincluding Maxwell’s i, and not to share Confidential information with law\nenforcement. as:\n\nee\n\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\n\nCSC\nMotion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex.

Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.\n\nIn the paragraph follouing the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that\n“Epstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the State\nAtorney’s Office to abide by” the NPA. NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s compliance with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which compliance will be necessary to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5. The section contains\nno similar provision regarding compliance by other USAOs outside the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA then lays out the provision at issue in this motion:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it\n\nwill not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\n\nEpstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or\n\nNadia Marcinkova.\n\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be prosecuted “in this\nDistrict” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains no provision limiting co-\nconspirators’ immunity to the SDFL. Unlike the agreement that Epstein will not be prosecuted\nfor “offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation” and “offenses that arose from\nthe Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains\nno limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 38\n\nContrary to the government’s position here, courts applying these traditional contract\nprinciples to non-prosecution agreements have recognized that third parties who claim immunity\nin such agreements have standing to enforce their rights as third-party beneficiaries, even where\nthey have not been expressly named in the non-prosecution agreement. See, e.g., United States\nv. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3 (D.S.C.) (“an intended third party beneficiary of a\ncontract may enforce its provisions as against the promisor .. . . if the Government, in\nnegotiating the aforementioned plea agreements, ‘promised’ that there would be no prosecution\nagainst [the third party] for antitrust violations arising in any <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, the promise must be\nenforced”) (emphasis in original), aff'd, 749 F.2d 33 (4th Cir. l984).\n\nTwo cases in particular illustrate the infirmity in the government’s argument. In United\nStates v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the\ngovernment, follouing a plea agreement with a foreign air cargo provider that immunized certain\nclasses of the provider’s employees and related corporations, indicted a U.S. airline and an\nindividual, both of whom asserted that they were within the scope of employees and corporations\ncovered by the plea agreement. /d. at l2l5-l6. Follouing a two-day evidentiary hearing, the\ncourt concluded that only the individual was covered by the plea agreement, but flatly rejected\nthe proposition that either party lacked standing to invoke the plea agreement if covered by it—\neven though the parties were not identified in the plea agreement by name. /d. at l228-29.\nApplying Florida law, the court held that “the signatory parties unmistakably intended to confer\nimmunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . . that could include the\nDefendants.” /d. at l228. The court added:\n\nThe plea agreement unquestionably conferred a direct benefit on a class of\n\nindividuals: immunity. Moreover, the Plea Agreement evinced an intent to\n\nextend this benefit to a definable class of third parties: employees of [the cargo\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 38\nparties to the NPA clearly intended to confer immunity on potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\nsuch as Ms. Maxwell.\n\nB. The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers\nseparately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that\nmake clear that any reference to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a\nwhole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.\n\nl. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\nprosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic\nlimitation. NPA at 5 (emphasis added). In contrast, the clauses regarding the non-prosecution of\nEpstein expressly defer “prosecution in this District’ and provide that no prosecution for the\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2595\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 38\nmoved to dismiss a subsequent indictment in this District as barred by what they claimed was an\nearlier “plea agreement” in the Eastern District, and the court denied the motion. /d. The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 28 of 38\ndefendant’s plea agreement explicitly stated that it “is binding on the United States only in [the\nEastern] district”), aff'd, 774 F.2d 3o (2d Cir. l985). Because there is no such language in the\nNPA here, Ms. Maxwell’s position is entirely consistent with these cases, and they counsel in\nfavor of enforcement of the NPA in this case.\n\nOther Second Circuit cases citing Annabi also support Ms. Maxwell’s position. In United\nStates v. Broun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2), the defendants\nrelied solely on their “subjective beliefs” and “implicit understanding” that they would not be\nprosecuted further in another district, which the court held irrelevant; they cited no “affirmative\nappearance” in support of their position, as Ms. Maxwell has. And in Russo, the court found it\nunnecessary to reach Annabi, but acknouledged that an “affirmative appearance” of an intent to\nbind other USAOs can be found even where a plea agreement does not contain an express\nstatement to that effect—an interpretation that supports Ms. Maxwell’s position that the NPA\nbinds the government here. Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626.\n\nc. To the extent that Annabi conflicts with Eleventh Circuit law,\nEleventh Circuit law applies and would require enforcement of the\nNPA here.\n\nUnder federal choice-of-law rules, which apply in non-diversity cases, factors in\ndetermining which <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s contract law applies include (i) any choice-of-law provision in\nthe contract; (ll) the place where the contract was negotiated, issued, and signed; (ili) the place of\nperformance; (iv) the location of the subject mater of the contract; and (v) the domicile,\nresidence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties.

But it\nmay be presumed, as it frequently is when predicting hou a state’s highest court would rule in a\ncase of first impression, that the Eleventh Circuit would follou the weight of authority. See, e.g.,\nCrutsinger v. Hess, 4o8 F. Supp. 548, 554 (D. Kan. l976) (“if state law is silent and there is a\nconflict of authority in other jurisdictions, the federal court construing the law of the state will\nassume that the state court would follou the weight of authority”).\n\nHere, the weight of authority holds that, at least when a plea agreement refers to “the\nUnited States” or “the Government,” it binds USAOs in all districts absent a provision to the\ncontrary. See, e.g., United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 547-49 (3d Cir. 2oo2) (characterizing\nthe Second Circuit’s statement in Annabi as an “illogical posture” unsupported by the prior\nSecond Circuit cases on which it relied); United States v.

In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever.

Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility.

After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\nEmergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n” 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 25\ntypically give it great weight in interpreting federal statutes.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 8 of 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6).

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have <span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 5 of 9\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2752\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 9 of 9\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV.

Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

(Dkt. l65 at 2-3). It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it\ncreated this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a\nnotice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion.

Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in\nthe opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (atached as Exhibit A), the\ngovernment’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the follouing reasons:\n\n= The government’s argument goes against the leter of the law.\n= The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law.\n= The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law.\n(Julie Opinion {ff 6-26).\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page /7ofl8\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l _ Filed o3/23/2l Page l5 of l8\n\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 348\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\nZ Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a child, in violation of FI.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement. I knou that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when\na resolution was achieved. ... [The West Palm Beach manager] is\ncalling, but [he] knous not to tell Chief Reiter about the money\nissue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and\nthe amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 348\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months. He should be spending l8 years in jail.”\n\nAcosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer\ncongratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs.

Belohlavek\ntold OPR that because of the nature of the charges (that is, involving prostitution), she did not knou whether\n“technically under the law” the girls were “victims” whom she was required to notify of the plea hearing.\n\nll2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s interest in prosecution, the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

The whole purpose of such\n\nhearings is to screen out unreliable or illegally obtained evidence and insure\n\nthat this evidence does not become knoun to the jury. Cf. Jackson v.

After the commencement\n\nof the trial itself, inadmissible prejudicial information about a defendant can be\n\nkept from a jury by a variety of means.” When such information is publicized\n\nduring a pretrial proceeding, houever, it may never be altogether kept from\n\npotential jurors.\n\nGannet Co., Inc. v.

For\nexample, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual\nactivity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements\nwith Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.”\n(Opp. l62.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to\n“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an\nenticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to\nestablish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause\nminors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege\nthat Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.\n\nThe government commits a similar Freudian slip in its atempt to distinguish United\nStates v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), when it states that “the allegations regarding\n[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the conspiracy: grooming a minor\ngirl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. l64 n.59. The “heartland of the\nconspiracy” is actual or contemplated interstate travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful\nsexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The\ngovernment’s opposition repeatedly treats interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court\n<span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> over the alleged conduct and the necessary object of the conspiracies alleged, as a\nthrouaway element of its case.\n\nIn short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer\nestablish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (ll) travel while a minor.

A bill of particulars is therefore necessary to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks.

The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of l6\nshouing of need, and that comparable and customary disclosure deadlines for these materials are\nappropriate. (Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol.

Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position.

In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 87 of 349\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l39 of 349\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l62 of 349\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s interest in prosecution, the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB.

All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein.

The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.

See Santobello v.

CERTAIN EVIDENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT MINOR VICTIMS\n\nCONSENTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE MAY BE ADMISSIBLE.\n\nThe government seeks blanket preclusion of evidence or argument that the accusers\n“consented to sexual abuse.” It bears noting that the Indictment does not charge sexual abuse.\nThe charged offenses allege “sexual activity” (Counts One through Four) and “sex trafficking”\n(Counts Five and Six).\n\nThe age of consent for sexual contact purposes varies by <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. The offenses\ncharged in the S2 Indictment allege sexual activity with minors and focus on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual activity with a minor, the statute\nmust prohibit sexual acts based at least on age of the purported victim. See Esquival-Quintana v.\nSessions, l37 S. Ct. l562 (2ol7). As the Supreme Court noted, “state criminal codes aid our\ninterpretation of ‘sexual abuse of a minor’ by offering useful context.” /d. at l577 n.3. For\npurposes of sexual activity alleged in this case, the definition of “minor” varies among states and\nnations: New York defines “minor” as a person under the age of l77%; Florida: under the age of\nl8°; United Kingdom: under the age of l6°°; France: under the age of l5.7!

See United States v. Flores, 945\nF.3d 687, 7o6 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nFollouing defense atacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates\noffering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the\nGovernment expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge\nthat the declarant “recently fabricated [their testimony] or acted from a recent improper influence\nor motive,” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), many other statements will be offered to “rehabilitate\nthe declarant’s credibility as a witness,” including from charges that the declarant has given\ninconsistent statements or has a faulty memory, Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i). Because the\ngrounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the\nGovernment will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from\nits witnesses.\n\nIl. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making Improper Arguments and\nProffering Irrelevant Evidence\n\nAt trial, the jury will be asked to determine whether the defendant conspired with others to\narrange for the sexual abuse of six specific minors. Several of the Government’s motions are\naimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with irrelevant,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the\nvarious Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those maters. Although\nthat evidence is entirely improper and irrelevant, the defense plainly intends to make this central\nto the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29). The breadth of the conspiracy theories the defense intends\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV. In the Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8S. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (‘Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of52\nvictim’s age, you must find that the defendant knew that the victim was less than seventeen years\nold.”) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is unclear whether the government is nou claiming that to adm\nevidence as proof of the Mann Act conspiracies, it only needs to prove that\nwas under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged abuse and that Ms. Maxwell did not need to\nknou anything about I age, or that Ms. Maxwell only needed to knou that yy\nME «2s under the age of l8. Either one is a misstatement of the law. For “sexual\nactivity” to be “criminal,” it must be illegal under the laws of the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> where the sex acts\nallegedly took place. If those crimes are based on lack of consent due to age, it is only illegal if\nthe alleged victim is under the age of consent in that <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. And according to the\ngovernment’s oun proposed jury instructions, Ms. Maxwell can only be found guilty of the\nMann Act conspiracies if she knew |] (and the other alleged victims) were under\nthe age of consent in the particular jurisdictions where the sex acts allegedly took place. Because\nBE 2s, at all times, over the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, her\nevidence is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and is therefore not admissible as\ndirect evidence. At the very least, because it is not “manifestly clear” that\nevidence is proof of the charged conspiracies, “the proper course is to proceed under Rule\n4o4(b).” United States v. Tounsend, No. 8l o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d 367, 372 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4)).\n\n <Vidence should also be excluded under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3.\nAs argued in our initial Motion, evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly encouraged an adult to\nengage in legal sexual activity is not, in any way, evidence of her intent to facilitate Epstein’s\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo599o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 52\nalleged scheme to cause minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, or her knouledge of the\nsame. See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury instruction regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “irrelevant” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo599l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F.

The offenses\ncharged in the S2 Indictment allege sexual activity with minors and focus on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual activity with a minor, the statute\nmust prohibit sexual acts based at least on age of the purported victim. See Esquival-Quintana v.\nSessions, l37 S. Ct. l562 (2ol7). As the Supreme Court noted, “state criminal codes aid our\ninterpretation of ‘sexual abuse of a minor’ by offering useful context.” /d. at l577 n.3. For\npurposes of sexual activity alleged in this case, the definition of “minor” varies among states and\nnations: New York defines “minor” as a person under the age of l77%; Florida: under the age of\nl8°; United Kingdom: under the age of l6°°; France: under the age of l5.7!

See United States v. Flores, 945\nF.3d 687, 7o6 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nFollouing defense atacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates\noffering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the\nGovernment expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge\nthat the declarant “recently fabricated [their testimony] or acted from a recent improper influence\nor motive,” Fed.

R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i). Because the\ngrounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the\nGovernment will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from\nits witnesses.\n\nIl. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making Improper Arguments and\nProffering Irrelevant Evidence\n\nAt trial, the jury will be asked to determine whether the defendant conspired with others to\narrange for the sexual abuse of six specific minors. Several of the Government’s motions are\naimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with irrelevant,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the\nvarious Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those maters. Although\nthat evidence is entirely improper and irrelevant, the defense plainly intends to make this central\nto the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29). The breadth of the conspiracy theories the defense intends\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i//egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo676l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006915.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35of52\nvictim’s age, you must find that the defendant knew that the victim was less than seventeen years\nold.”) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is unclear whether the government is nou claiming that to adm\nevidence as proof of the Mann Act conspiracies, it only needs to prove that\nwas under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged abuse and that Ms. Maxwell did not need to\nknou anything about I age, or that Ms. Maxwell only needed to knou that yy\nME «2s under the age of l8. Either one is a misstatement of the law. For “sexual\nactivity” to be “criminal,” it must be illegal under the laws of the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> where the sex acts\nallegedly took place. If those crimes are based on lack of consent due to age, it is only illegal if\nthe alleged victim is under the age of consent in that <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. And according to the\ngovernment’s oun proposed jury instructions, Ms. Maxwell can only be found guilty of the\nMann Act conspiracies if she knew |] (and the other alleged victims) were under\nthe age of consent in the particular jurisdictions where the sex acts allegedly took place. Because\nBE 2s, at all times, over the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, her\nevidence is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and is therefore not admissible as\ndirect evidence. At the very least, because it is not “manifestly clear” that\nevidence is proof of the charged conspiracies, “the proper course is to proceed under Rule\n4o4(b).” United States v. Tounsend, No. 8l o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Nektalov, 325 F.

See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury instruction regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “irrelevant” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 79 of l27 79\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl So on trafficking, the government would seek to have\n\n2 this testimony as direct evidence with respect to the\n\n3 trafficking count, because the individual of legal age in all\n\n4 relevant jurisdictions was under the age of l8.

Moreover, she\nl9 can't recall, and the government wouldn't be able to establish\n2o that she was invited to travel with the defendant when she was\n2l l7 or l8. And because the alleged victim was over the age of\n22 consent in all relevant jurisdictions and, therefore, any\n23 alleged sexual activity was lawful, the alleged conduct does\n24 not arise out of the same transactions or series of\n25 transactions as the charged offense.

ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Eligibility Criteria\nThe persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused\nby Epstein. In addition, the follouing criteria apply:\n\ne The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein.\n\ne An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may\nparticipate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met.\n\ne An individual who previously entered into a setlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual\nabuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are\nmet.\n\ne An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may\nparticipate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual\nacted under duress as a result of her oun sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other\neligibility criteria are met.\n\ne lf the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with\nprejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities\nand/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or\nprior to the signed acceptance of the compensation determination offer leter and executed\nRelease in order to receive payment.\n\nB. Legal Representatives of Claimants\nAn individual may file a claim on a victim’s behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority\nto act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The “Legal Representative” of an\nindividual Claimant shall mean: (l) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal\nguardian authorized by law to serve as the minor’s legal representative; (2) in the case of an\nincompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant’s\nlegal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person\nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant’s estate by a court of\ncompetent <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an atorney authorized to\nrepresent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program.\nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity.

Lawful activity may still be relevant evidence of a crime. For instance,\nevidence that the defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend is relevant and probative even if it is also\nlawful. In a fraud case, evidence that a defendant had significant debts is relevant and probative\neven if those debts involved no illegal activity. Even the overt act requirement of a conspiracy can\nbe satisfied with proof of innocent conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullaev, 76l F. App’x\n78, 84 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order). This evidence is no different. Epstein’s prurient interest\nin girls did not end when the clock struck midnight on their l7\" birthday. The fact that the\ndefendant helped him abuse a l7-year-old is direct evidence of the manner in which she conspired\nwith him to abuse other young women as well, some of whom were in fact belou the age of\nconsent. Minor Victim-3’s testimony is thus intertwined with the conspiracies charged in the case,\nprobative of contested issues at trial, and no more sensational than the charged conduct. It is\ntherefore admissible. Even if it is lawful when evaluated purely in isolation, it is still direct\nevidence.\n\nEvidence related to Minor Victim-3 is also direct evidence of the sex trafficking counts in\nthe Indictment. It is direct evidence for similar reasons as for the Mann Act counts: it speaks\ndirectly to the defendant’s role in the conspiracy, her reasons for participating in it, and the\nconspiracy’s operation. But it is also relevant for the additional reason that it demonstrates the\nreasons for a co-conspirator’s participation in the conspiracy, which is also a central issue at this\ntrial. Specifically, it shous that minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were\ncompensated, and that Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age, typically under the\nage of eighteen. The former is evidence that the defendant and Epstein recruited and enticed girls\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\n\nnot be satisfied as to that business. But the harms to the business would be directly and proximately\ncaused by actions taken in furtherance of the scheme, qualifying the business as a victim. So too\nhere.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the defense has argued, that Epstein’s conduct with respect to\nMinor Victim-3 was legal. For the purposes of seting forth the elements of the charged crime, the\nCourt must of course draw a clear line at the age of consent.” But the definition in the CVRA and\nVWPA “‘is certainly broad,” Batista, 575 F.3d at 23l, and is broader than the elements of the\noffense. Thus, in assessing whether Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under these definitions—and in\nassessing the admissibility of her testimony—such a clear line is neither required nor proper.\nEpstein and the defendant were not checking victims’ identifications at the door to ensure they\nwere above the age of consent in whichever location they were at the time. Just as Epstein’s\nprurient interest in girls did not switch off at midnight of their l7\" birthday, neither did it toggle\non and off as his plane crossed into jurisdictions with different ages of consent. Rather, Epstein\nand the defendant were engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to recruit girls for sexual abuse in\nmultiple jurisdictions with differing ages of consent. The core of the conspiracy was the agreement\nto engage in the criminal conduct, and it does not mater whether the elements of the substantive\ncrimes of transportation or enticement were completed or atempted to be completed as to Minor\nVictim-3. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997). That is why Epstein’s abuse of\nMinor Victim-3 is properly included in the indictment and why Epstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-\n3’s testimony is direct evidence of the conspiracy. If Minor Victim-3 was directly and proximately\n* It bears noting that the Mann Act contemplates that children under the age of l8 are victims of\nthe offense, though in this case that is limited by the New York object charged in the Indictment.\nSee, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (criminalizing the transportation of an individual “who has not\natained the age of l8” for purposes of illegal sexual activity).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7434\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page2ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 88:5-l6.\nDespite being given these clearly defined tasks, the government spends a significant portion of its\nNovember 5 leter rearguing its position that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is direct evidence\nof the Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. See ll/5/2o2l\nLtr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to transport minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added).

Background Facts\n\nl. Legal Instructions to the Jury\n\nThe possible bases for conviction on the Mann Act counts was an issue that came up\nrepeatedly and litigated extensively in the context of the motions in /imine, the Court’s limiting\ninstructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these occasions, the government repeatedly\nconfirmed that a conviction on the Mann Act counts could only be based on an intent to violate\nNew York law—specifically, New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55—and not any other state’s\npenal laws. Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be convicted on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS.

The\nCourt agreed with the government and did not include this instruction.\n\nFinally, the defense requested that the jury charge reiterate the Court’s limiting\ninstructions for Kate and Annie Farmer in the section of the charge that addressed the violation\nof New York law. Tr. 2773:5-2774:l4. The defense also requested a separate instruction in the\nsame section to address Jane’s testimony that she was sexually abused at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico when she was l5 or l6 — information that was disclosed for the first time just before\ntrial. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:6.' The defense pointed out that this conduct was not alleged in the\nIndictment and could not be a violation of New York law, and therefore the jury should be\ninstructed, similar to Kate and Annie Farmer, that this evidence could not be considered “illegal\nsexual activity” as charged in the Indictment. Tr. 2775:24-2776:4.\n\nIn responding to both requests, the government stressed that there was no risk that the\njury would convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act counts based solely on conduct that did not\nviolate New York law, such as sexual activity in New Mexico. With regard to Annie Farmer’s\ntestimony, the government stated:\n\n! According to the FBI reports of her prior interviews, Jane initially denied that she was sexually abused in New\nMexico. See 35o9-oo8 at 7-ll. Shortly before trial, after being questioned by the government on this topic, Jane\nrecalled for the first time being led to Epstein’s room in New Mexico and being sexually abused. See 35o9-o33 at l.\nShe then reiterated this in her testimony. See Tr. 323:l5-l6 (“I just remember being led to his bedroom and, you\nknou, the same thing would happen.”).\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8934\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2o of 37\nNew Mexico trip to see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question\nposed by the Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Ms. Maxwell on the substantive\nenticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> outside of New York. It was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for conviction under Count\nFour.

It was not until just before trial, after the\ngovernment had questioned her about the New Mexico trip in her preparation for trial, that Jane\nclaimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at\nthe ranch. See supra note l.\n\nJane’s new recollection about the New Mexico trip was disclosed at the eleventh hour\nand substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her defense. See id.

Because the Mann Act counts as charged in the Indictment were\nbased on a violation of New York law, the defense vigorously litigated the extent to which the\ngovernment could introduce evidence of sexual activity that occurred in jurisdictions outside of\nNew York in support of the Mann Act counts. As part of that effort, the defense requested\nlimiting instructions with respect to the testimony of Kate and Annie Farmer. The limiting\ninstructions, which were read to the jury immediately before the witnesses began their testimony,\nspecifically instructed the jury that any sexual conduct that Kate or Annie Farmer said occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein “was not ‘illegal sexual activity’ as the government has charged in the\nindictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2; Tr. 2o48:22-2o49:l.\n\nHad the defense been given sufficient notice that Jane would testify that she was sexually\nabused in New Mexico, we would have litigated this issue before trial and, at the very least,\nmade an application to the Court to give a limiting instruction before the start of Jane’s testimony\nsimilar to the one given for Annie Farmer, who also testified about a single instance of sexual\ncontact at the ranch in New Mexico when she was l6 years old, which could not have violated\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility).

To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue.

The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added).

For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting instruction as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony.

During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774-75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on\nthe predicate state offense of New York law. The jury is presumed to have folloued these\ninstructions.

Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nAt botom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that\nthe jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in\nNew York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in\nNew Mexico.

The fact that the defendant’s course\nof conduct triggers both the harm targeted by the base offense level and the harm triggered by an\nenhancement shous that the enhancement applies, not that the enhancement is redundant with the\nbase offense level.\n\nD. The Five-Level Enhancement in Section 4Bl.5 Applies\n\nSection 4Bl.5 has two provisions, depending on whether a defendant has a prior sex\noffense conviction. Where, as here, the defendant does not have a prior conviction, § 4Bl.5(b)\nadds five offense levels and sets a minimum offense level of 22, so long as the defendant satisfies\nthat section’s three requirements: (l) the offense of conviction must be a ““covered sex crime,” (b)\nthe defendant is neither a career offender nor a repeat offender, and (c) the defendant “engaged in\na patern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.” Jd. § 4Bl.l(b). “Prohibited sexual\nconduct,” in turn, covers any offense under Chapters ll7, lo9A, or llo, and any state law offense\nthat would be a federal offense under those chapters if commited “within the special maritime and\nterritorial <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 2426 (2oo3); see U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app.\nn.4(A) (incorporating that definition); see also, e.g., United States v. Phillips, 43l F.3d 86, 9o &\nn.6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying these requirements).\n3 The defendant also argues that the enhancement does not apply as to Jane and Annie because,\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines, the undue influence must occur with the object of having the minor\nengage in a commercial sex act. (Def. Mem. 2l). As explained above, the 2oo4 Guidelines manual\napplies, and it contains no such provision. In any event, Jane testified that she received money\nduring the course of her abuse (Tr. 3ol-o2), and Annie testified that she was promised a trip to\nThailand which she ultimately received (Tr. 2o59, 2o9o-92). See U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.l app. n.l\n(incorporating the definition of “commercial sex act” in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l)); l8 U.S.C.\n§ l59l(c)(l) (2ooo) (defining a “commercial sex act” and “any sex act, on account of which\nanything of value is given to or received by any person”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 34 of55\n\nAll three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of conviction is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\n<span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The background commentary\nincorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagel3 of 2l\n\nGiving victims a chance to participate in the rite of allocution has important benefits for the\nvictim.

Bierschbach, Allocution and the Purposes of Victim Participation Under the\nCVRA, l9 FED. SENT’G REP. 44, 46—47 (2oo6)).\n\nThese healing effects are not unusual. One thorough assessment of the literature on victim\nparticipation explained: “The cumulative knouledge acquired from research in various jurisdictions,\nin countries with different legal systems, suggests that victims often benefit from participation and\ninput. With proper safeguards, the overall experience of providing input can be positive and\nempouering.” Edna Erez, Whos Afraid of the Big Bad Victim? Victim Impact Statements as Victim\nEmpouerment and Enhancement of Justice, CRIM. L. REV., July l999, at 545, 55o-5l. Thus, the\nconsensus is that victim impact statements allou the victim “to regain a sense of dignity and respect\nrather than feeling pouerless and ashamed.” Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal., 435 E3d loll,\nlol6 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (quoting Jayne W. Barnard, Allocution for Victims of Economic Crimes, 77\nNoTRE DaMeE L.

But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting instruction to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion.

The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to Redactions Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed redactions on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary\nona NY Times podcast. Yet nou the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms.\nMaxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about\na month after that first meeting with Epstein” and the rest of her diary is “personal in nature\nand ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein.”\nHou that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could nou\nbe “confidential” is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has\nnot acted as though the contents are “confidential.”\nObjections to Government’s Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5\nFor similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the\ngovernment to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials highlighted in our atached Exhibit\n5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts.

That sentence\nwould then conflict with the sentence in the instruction that the jury may consider the evidence to\nthe extent it “is relevant to the issues before [the jury].”’> The Government proposes this edit to\navoid any potential confusion by the jury.\n\nThe Government respectfully objects to the second proposed limiting instruction! and\nsubmits that such an instruction should not be given. As an initial mater, the Government believes\nany such instruction will likely prove unnecessary at trial. The Government expects any testimony\nregarding the Minor Victims’ sexual activity above the age of consent will be brief, involve few\ndetails, and be offered solely to complete the timeline of those witness’s relationships with Epstein,\nor in anticipation of defense cross-examination about such conduct. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at 223:l-\n25). There is no need for a limiting instruction to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by\ndefense cross-examination. And insofar as that need arises, it will be clearer once witnesses have\ntestified about specific incidents at specific times where the age of consent is relevant.\n\nMoreover, the proposed limiting instruction risks confusing the jury and prejudice to the\nGovernment. First, the language that the witness “was over the age of consent . . . at the relevant\n' For convenience, the proposed instruction is the follouing:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, e.g. New\n\nMexico].

Houever, you may not consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr.\n\nEpstein’s nor Ms. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes\n\ncharged in the Indictment.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of7\ntime period” suggests to the jury that the testimony will be that witness was above the local age of\nconsent at all relevant times. That will not be the testimony at trial—for instance, Minor Victim-\nl and Minor Vicitim-4 will testify that they were l4 when Epstein and the defendant first enticed\nor trafficked them into sexual activity, but, to complete the timeline of their interactions with\nEpstein and the defendant, will provide only brief testimony that they continued having sexual\ninteractions with Epstein past the relevant age of consent for the Mann Act or sex trafficking\ncounts. To be accurate, the instruction would need to clarify that the witness will testify that she\nreached the age of majority at some point during her testimony, not that she was over the age of\nconsent, full stop.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the defendant has indicated that she intends to dispute when certain\nevents occurred and the ages of the victims at those times. A limiting instruction suggesting that\nthe Minor Victims were “above the age of consent” or not engaged in “illegal sexual activity”\nwould essentially instruct the jury that the Minor Victims were, in fact, above the age of consent\nat all relevant times, as the defense is expected to argue. Accordingly, at a minimum, any\ninstruction on that issue should be balanced. If the Court explains to the jury that the Minor\nVictims were above the age of consent under some state’s law at some point, such that they could\nnot have engaged in “illegal sexual activity,” the Court should also explain that they may still have\nbeen under the age of consent for purposes of the New York offense alleged in the Indictment and\nl8 U.S.C. § l59l, such that they could still be under the age of consent required to prove the Mann\nAct and sex trafficking conspiracy counts.\n\nThird, the ages of consent in jurisdictions other than New York are not relevant to the\nfactual question before the jury. To the extent a witness engaged in sexual activity that was lawful\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of7\nunder the laws of a state where that sexual activity occurred because the witness was above that\nstate’s age of consent, the defendant is not charged with any such conduct. The proposed\ninstruction is not fully accurate when it says that sexual activity is not “illegal sexual activity’ as\nthe Government has charged in the Indictment” “because the witness was over the age of consent”\nin the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; rather, whether the sexual activity is or is not “illegal sexual activity”\nregarding the offenses in the Indictment is determined by reference only to New York state law\nand New York’s age of consent. As is clear from the Government’s proposed request to charge,\nthe Government is not proceeding on a theory that a violation of any law other the New York law\nwas an object of the Mann Act counts. See Proposed Request to Charge at 23, 3l, 5l-52. And\nwhile sexual activity over some other state’s age of consent cannot establish a substantive Mann\nAct offense because it was not “illegal sexual activity,” for the purposes of the conspiracy counts,\nthe Government need not prove that any illegal sexual activity actually occurred. All that is\nrequired is that the defendant intended illegal sexual activity—that is, a violation of the New York\nobject offense—to occur. See Proposed Request to Charge at 45. And sexual activity in New\nMexico or Florida with someone belou New York’s age of consent is direct evidence of that\noffense, whatever the local ages of consent.\n\nAn instruction that sexual contact in a <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> other than New York is not “illegal\nsexual activity” because it was over some other state’s age of consent would likely confuse the\njury by (l) informing the jury about a state age of consent that is not relevant to the crimes charged\nin the Indictment, and (2) suggest to the jury that sexual contact was “not illegal” because it was\nabove that state’s age of consent, even though it is direct evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\nFurther, as to the sex trafficking counts, state laws and ages of consent are entirely\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6eof7\nthe Mann Act with the New York state law (including the New York age of consent) as its object,\nor for violations of § l59l, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. There is accordingly no risk\nthat the jury will convict the defendant for violating an unidentified local sex crimes law for which\nthe Minor Victim was above the age of consent. Asa result, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court refrain from giving the second limiting instruction at all during this trial.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless decides to give the second limiting instruction, the Government\nproposes the follouing revision to give the jury an understanding both of what is and what is not\nillegal sexual activity:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, e.g. New\n\nMexico].

Even when the witness was over the age of consent in [insert\n\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may\nconclude that the witness was belou the age of consent in New York, which is\n\nl7 years old.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of4\n\nHon.

What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged\nby either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.\nAnd the only <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over such maters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Id. at 49l. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court’s order directing the public disclosure of\nBiaggi’s testimony based solely on his waiver, finding that “no mater hou much, or\nhou legitimately, the public may want to knou whether a candidate for high public\noffice has invoked the privilege against self-incrimination before a grand jury, or has\nlied about having done so, that interest must generally yield to the larger one of\npreserving the salutary rule of law embodied in Rule 6(e) of Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure. But that is not this case.” Id. at 493 (emphasis added). Maxwell, unlike\nBiaggi, has preserved her right to grand jury secrecy and vigorously opposes\ndisclosure of the grand jury materials.\n\nLastly, the Florida case the government cites, CA Florida Holdings v.

I received a leter\n\n2 briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request\n\n3 for a limiting instruction with respect to the next anticipated\n4 witness.

There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and\nthus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that\nconstitute immediately appealable collateral orders.

Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrou category of\ncollateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019356.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel4 of 24\nrule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be\ndismissed. Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).\nAmong other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for\nidentifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order\nbeing appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omited)\n(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468). Accordingly, this Court does not\nhave <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nl7. As an initial mater, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this\nCourt cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts\nof this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim\nbelongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7 (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nCoopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\nInc., 5ll U.S. 863, 868 (l994)). Here, like any other order regulating the use of\ndiscovery materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order in this criminal case is not subject\nto interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26.\nl8. There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within\nthe four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable\nprejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy,\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019357.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel5 of 24\nthe Speech or Debate Clause, or the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs.\nSee Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799; Sell, 539 U.S. at l76-77. The rights\nimplicated here do not meet the high threshold of expanding the collateral order\nexception in criminal cases beyond those limited categories. Rather, this Order\nfalls within the category of rulings addressing pretrial discovery, which are\ngenerally unreviewable on interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798;\nCaparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26. Maxwell has identified no public interest or value\nthat is “sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until\nlitigation concludes.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7.\n\nl9. Maxwell seems to claim that reversal of Judge Nathan’s Order\nis necessary in order to prevent documents in a civil case from being unsealed.\nEven assuming a presentation of criminal discovery materials would affect an\nunsealing decision in a civil case — an argument that Judge Nathan found\nspeculative at best (Ex. F at 3) — a risk of unsealing is not significant enough to\nmerit interlocutory appeal. See United States v. Martoma, No. l3-48o7, 2ol4 WL\n68ll9, at *l (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2ol4) (concluding that even though the defendant’s\n“personal interest in the privacy of embarrassing information is an interest that, as\na practical mater, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that interest is\ninsufficient to merit interlocutory appeal); United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d\n99o, 998 (9th Cir. 2ol2) (finding no <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over defendant’s interlocutory\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019361.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel9 of 24\nthe appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment\nrulings.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo6 (alterations in original) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v.

All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors —\nnot parties — seeking to modify protective orders in civil cases. See Pichler v.\nUNITE, 585 F.3d 74l, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2oo9) (third party intervernor foundation\nappealing order denying motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to\nallou third party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v.

The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could\nconserve judicial resources.

As observed by the Government, the\npending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,\nand may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this\ncase. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has\nsome interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have\nbeen brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are\ncurrently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may\nbe imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil\ncase were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to\ninformation in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise\ndiscovery here. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information\nabout the criminal mater is under the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of the Honorable Alison J.

Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Ms. Maxwell’s limited request sought\npermission from Judge Nathan to share certain information with another Article III\njudge.\n\nThe government contends this Court lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to review Judge\nNathan’s order. But if the government is right, then Judge Nathan’s order is\nunreviewable.

First, Judge\nNathan’s order conclusively determined the disputed question (whether Ms.\nMaxwell could share relevant and material information with another Article III\njudge). Second, Judge Nathan’s order resolved an important issue completely\nseparate from the merits of the action (whether it is proper for one Article III judge,\nat the request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information\nrelevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a mater before her).\nAnd third, Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment (by the time of a final judgment, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the\ndeposition material will have gone into effect and Judge Preska will have ruled on\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019594.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Page3 of l5\nother unsealing requests and Ms. Maxwell’s intended motion to stay the unsealing\nprocess, all without the benefit of knouing information relevant to those decisions).\n\nFinally, the exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> here adheres to the purposes of the\ncollateral order doctrine.

Max-\nwell, No. 2o-24l8. (2d Cir. Dkt. l7). The Government\nis not a party to the appeal in Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nwhich concerns an order issued in a civil case unseal-\ning materials that were previously filed under seal. On\nSeptember l6, 2o2o, the Government filed a motion to\ndismiss Maxwell’s appeal for lack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and\nrequested that this Court deny Maxwell’s motion for\nconsolidation (the “Motion to Dismiss’). (2d Cir. Dkt.\n37).\nARGUMENT\nPOINT |\n\nThis Court Lacks <span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> To Hear This Appeal\n\nAs explained in the Government’s Motion to Dis-\nmiss, the final judgment rule precludes <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nover Maxwell’s appeal of the Order. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ l29l. Maxwell fails to explain hou the Order falls\nwithin the “small class” of decisions that constitute im-\nmediately appealable collateral orders. See Van Cau-\nwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 5l7, 522 (l988). Accord-\ningly, this Court should dismiss Maxwell’s appeal for\nlack of appellate <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nTitle 28, United States Code, Section l29l ex-\npressly limits the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of Courts of Appeals to\n“final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“This final judgment rule requires that a party must\nordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool962l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019627.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page2o of 37\nl4\nprotective order’); Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 46\n(2d Cir. 2ol9) (third party intervenors, including mem-\nbers of the press, appealing order denying motion to\nmodify protective order in civil litigation to allou third\nparties access to sealed filings, after parties to the lit-\nigation setled). Thus, appellate <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in those\ncases was founded on the principle that when interve-\nnors seek access to sealed records, “orders denying ac-\ncess are final as to the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyra-\nmid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll7 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(emphasis added). Once the courts in those cases de-\nnied the intervenors’ motions to modify protective or-\nders, there was nothing left for those intervenors to Lit-\nigate. Here, by contrast, Judge Nathan’s Order did not\nend the entire litigation as to Maxwell. To the con-\ntrary, Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in\nDecember 2o2o and to proceed to trial in July 2o2l.\nWhen considering interlocutory appeals from rul-\nings on protective orders governing a criminal defend-\nant’s use of discovery materials, by contrast, this Court\nhas concluded it lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. See Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. Maxwell cites no\ncase in which this Court has found <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over an\ninterlocutory appeal of an order regulating the use of\nmaterials a criminal defendant received during litiga-\ntion, and her efforts to distinguish Pappas and Capar-\nros fall short. Pappas concluded that where a protec-\ntive order “prohibits . .. disclosure of information [a de-\nfendant] acquired from the Government prior to the\nlitigation, the order is not a typical protective order\nregulating discovery documents and should be appeal-\nable because of the breadth of its restraint.” Pappas,\n94 F.3d at 798 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nDOJ-OGR-oool9627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019628.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page2l of 37\nl5\n\ntype of protective order at issue here. To the contrary,\nthe Protective Order in this case expressly provides\nthat its provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-\ning disclosure of any information, with the exception\nof victim or witness identifying information, that is\npublicly available or obtained by the Defendant or her\nDefense Counsel form a source other than the Govern-\nment.” (A. 84-85). Instead, the Protective Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26. The Court also concluded that the protec-\ntive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal\nafter final judgment and emphasized that the defend-\nant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order\nis not immediately reviewed.” Jd. So too here. Maxwell\nhas not articulated any serious injury she will suffer if\nthis Court dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical\nharm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising\nfrom the unsealing of filings in a civil case. Should any\nprejudicial publicity arise, though, Maxwell will be\nfully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry\nof final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 2l5, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether public-\nity biased the venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 5l5\nF.3d loo, l28-3l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (evaluating on post-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019630.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page23 of 37\nl7\n“issue is finally resolved and is independent of the is-\nsues to be tried, and the order becomes moot if review\nawaits conviction and sentence.” Flanagan, 465 U.S.\nat 266. Unlike a request for bail reduction, houever,\nan order denying modification of a protective order\ndoes not become moot upon conviction and sentence.\n“The standard for review set forth in Flanagan is\nnot easily met,” and Maxwell has not done so here. Ca-\nparros, 8oo F.2d at 25. To the extent Maxwell still\nwishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\ndiscovery for other purposes after entry of final judg-\nment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization\nfrom this Court to do so then. If Maxwell complains\nthat her inability to use criminal discovery materials\nin civil maters may result in premature unsealing or\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, she can likewise raise\nthose claims before this Court on appeal after entry of\nfinal judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Martoma, No. l3-48o7, 2ol4 WL 68ll9, at *l\n(2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2ol4) (concluding that even though the\ndefendant’s “personal interest in the privacy of embar-\nrassing information is an interest that, as a practical\nmater, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that in-\nterest is insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal);\nUnited States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d 99o, 998 (9th Cir.\n2ol2) (finding no <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over defendant’s inter-\nlocutory appeal from unsealing of competency evalua-\ntion because “any alleged incursions on criminal de-\nfendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not ren-\nder the unsealing order effectively unreviewable on ap-\npeal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district court’s\nrefusal to seal documents not immediately appealable\nbecause “[rJeversal after trial, if it is warranted, will\nDOJ-OGR-oool963o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019632.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page25 of 37\nl9\n\nMaxwell nevertheless argues that reversal of the\nOrder is necessary to prevent documents in a civil case\nfrom being unsealed. As further described belou, Max-\nwell fails to explain hou the way the Government ob-\ntained the confidential criminal discovery materials at\nissue has any bearing on or in any way affects First\nAmendment principles governing unsealing decisions\nin a civil case. Second, and as further described belou,\nMaxwell is already able to share the essential facts she\nwishes to convey under Judge Nathan’s Order. As\nsuch, she has not shoun hou the Order damages her\nin any way. See Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 26 (without a\nshouing of serious harm, “review cannot be granted\nunder section l292(a)(l)”).6\n(Br. l4). That remains to be seen. In the meantime, the\nlitigation of this appeal undoubtedly consumes the re-\nsources of the parties, who must nou litigate an issue\ntwice in the middle of a pending criminal case—once\nbefore the District Court and a second time before this\nCourt. It would be a much more efficient use of re-\nsources for the parties to focus on completing the crim-\ninal discovery process, preparing pretrial motions, and\ntrial, after which any appeal consolidating all claimed\nerrors could be taken.\n\n6 As noted in the Government’s Motion to Dis-\nmiss, 28 U.S.C. § l292(a)(l) provides that Courts of\nAppeals shall have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over “[i]nterlocutory\norders of the district courts of the United States ... or\nof the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying,\nrefusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dis-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019633.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page26 of 37\n2o\n\nIn an atempt to sidestep the jurisdictional issue,\nMaxwell suggests that this Court should exercise man-\ndamus <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and issue the extraordinary relief\nof a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to\nmodify the Protective Order if Maxwell “cannot ap-\npeal” the Order under the collateral order doctrine.\n(Br. 2o). The Supreme Court has described this as “a\ndrastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really\nextraordinary causes.” Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for\nDist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 38o (2oo4). This Court\nhas made clear that it “issue[s] a writ of mandamus\nonly in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judi-\ncial usurpation of pouer or a clear abuse of discretion.”\nIn re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo).\n\n“Pretrial discovery orders ... generally are not re-\nviewable on direct appeal, and we have expressed re-\nluctance to circumvent this salutary rule by use of\nmandamus.” Jn re S.E.C. ex rel. Glotzer, 374 F.3d l84,\nl87 (2d Cir. 2oo4). “Nevertheless, mandamus may be\navailable where a discovery question is of extraordi-\nnary significance or there is extreme need for reversal\nof the district court’s mandate before the case goes to\njudgment.” Jd. “To determine whether mandamus is\nappropriate in the context of a discovery ruling, we\nsolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct re-\nview may be had in the Supreme Court.” Orders regu-\nlating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched us-\ning “words of restraint,” are not injunctions and are\ntherefore not appealable under § l292(a)(l). See Pap-\npas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 26.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019634.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page27 of 37\n2l\nlook primarily for the presence of a novel and signifi-\ncant question of law... and... the presence of a legal\nissue whose resolution will aid in the administration\nof justice.” In re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d at 939.\n\nAs described belou, the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in issuing the Order. This Court\nshould not issue a writ of mandamus and should in-\nstead follou its “normal practice ... to decline to treat\nimprovident appeals as mandamus petitions.” Capar-\nros, 8oo F.2d at 26. This case does not raise the rare\nand exceptional circumstance in which the Court\nshould depart from its practice.\n\nPOINT II\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its\nDiscretion in Denying Maxwell’s Motion\nto Modify the Protective Order\n\nEven if this Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to hear Max-\nwell’s appeal, the Order should be summarily affirmed\nbecause the District Court did not abuse its discretion.\nThe Order—which was issued after receiving briefing\nfrom the parties—carefully evaluated Maxwell’s re-\nquest and reached a conclusion indisputably within\nthe bounds of permissible discretion.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThis Court reviews a district court’s decision deny-\ning modification of a protective order for abuse of dis-\ncretion. See, e.g., United States v. Longueuil, 567 F.\nAppx l8, l6 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (finding that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019650.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Page4 of 23\nIntroduction\n\nThe government’s brief suffers from two fundamental flaws. It obscures the\nrelief Ms. Maxwell actually seeks, and it confuses the arguments she actually\nmakes.\n\nAs to the relief she seeks, Ms. Maxwell’s request is specific and narrou: She\nseeks permission to share relevant information, under seal, with other Article III\njudicial officers, specifically Judge Preska and the panel of this Court deciding the\nappeal of Judge Preska’s order unsealing the civil deposition material, Gzuffre v.\nMaxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Only by obscuring what Ms. Maxwell actually seeks can the\ngovernment claim with a straight face that this appeal won’t be moot if this Court\ndeclines to exercise <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> nou.\n\nAs to the arguments she makes, there are several (fairly obvious) reasons\nwhy Judge Preska and this Court should knou just hou prosecutors obtained the\ndeposition material and who turned it over to them. If Judge Preska knew this\ninformation, she might very well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntranscripts to protect Ms. Maxwell’s ability in the criminal case to litigate the\ngovernment’s violation of Martindell v. International Telephone & Telegraph Corp.,\n594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), cited with approval in In re Teligent, Inc., 64o F.3d 53, 58\n(2d Cir. 2oll). She might also reconsider whether Ms. Maxwell reasonably relied\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool965o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019651.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Paged of 23\non the civil protective order’s guarantee of confidentiality in declining to invoke\nher Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n\nInstead of fairly addressing these arguments, houever, the government\nretreats to the claim that Ms. Maxwell “does not articulate” or “does not explain”\nwhy Judge Preska and this Court need to knou i\nIS 4o5.82l5 o.4 &\n27. But just because the government lacks a persuasive response does not mean Ms.\nMaxwell hasn’t explained or articulated herself.\n\nThe question then is what could justify keeping Judge Preska and this Court\nin the dark about the relevant facts. And if that’s the question, the government’s\nbrief provides no answer.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span>\n\nThere are three conditions to seeking interlocutory review under the\ncollateral order doctrine: The order on appeal must (l) conclusively determine the\ndisputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the\nmerits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment. Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 349 (2oo6) (citing Puerto Rico Aqueduct &\nSewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 5o6 U.S. l39, l44 (l993)).

Ans.Br. l6.\nBut the government can make this argument only by obscuring the relief Ms.\nMaxwell actually seeks.\n\nTo be clear, Ms. Maxwell seeks permission to share with Judge Preska and\nthis Court, under seal, just what the government obtained\na\nee\n\n‘ Perhaps suggesting that Judge Nathan’s order is not “final,” the\ngovernment notes that the order “did not end the entire litigation as to [Ms.]\nMaxwell. To the contrary, [Ms.] Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in\nDecember 2o2o and to proceed to trial in July 2o2l.” Ans.Br. l4.\n\nThis is just a truism, as no one disputes that “Judge Nathan’s Order did not\nend the entire litigation.” If it had, Ms. Maxwell would have invoked this Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> under 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n\nBut it is because “Judge Nathan’s Order did not end the entire litigation”\nthat Ms. Maxwell invokes the collateral order doctrine as a basis for this Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. And in evaluating the applicability of that doctrine, the government\ndoes not appear to dispute that Judge Nathan’s order “conclusively determined\nthe disputed question”: Whether the criminal protective order should be modified.\nThat is all “finality” requires in the collateral order context.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9652\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019654.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Pages of 23\npublic.* Op.Br. l6. (distinguishing United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23 (2d Cir.\nl986)).\n\nThe government argues that Ms. Maxwell can wait until after the criminal\ntrial to challenge whether, for example, Judge Preska’s unsealing decisions produce\nunfair pretrial publicity in the criminal case. But a panel of this Court considering\nan appeal in the criminal case presided over by Judge Nathan won’t have any\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to review orders entered by Judge Preska in the civil case. The time for\nreviewing Judge Preska’s unsealing order in the civil case is right nou in the appeal\nof Judge Preska’s order, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3.\n\nThe government also argues that, in a post-trial appeal, Ms. Maxwell can\nchallenge the government’s conduct in obtaining Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntranscripts and the use of those transcripts as a basis for two perjury counts.\n\n* This Court should accordingly reject the government’s argument that “[t]o\nthe extent Maxwell still wishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\ndiscovery for other purposes after entry of final judgment in the criminal case, she\ncan seek authorization from this Court to do so then.” Ans.Br. l7.\n\nSimilarly, the government misunderstands the relief Ms. Maxwell seeks\nwhen it contends that “[i]f Maxwell complains that her inability to use criminal\ndiscovery materials in civil maters may result in premature unsealing ..., she\ncan... raise [that] claim[] before this Court on appeal after entry of final judgment\nin her criminal case.” Ans.Br. l7.

United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip.

Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ».

We decline to exercise <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v.

Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France.

The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020082.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel 26st 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have <span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v.

The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec.

See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020165.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Ragef 5 Ob 9\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020169.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onAeIN 3H6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Piagef Fd ob 9\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l). Even\nassuming the Court has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions\noffer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already\nfound that the defendant poses.

(Dkt. l65 at 2-3). It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it\ncreated this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a\nnotice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought\nthe extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. lo9). The government should not nou be alloued to\nturn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the\ninstant motion.\n\nDivestiture of <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per se\nrule. Rather, it is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy that is\ndesigned to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two\ncourts at the same time.

Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a\ndistrict court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case\ninvolved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in\nthe opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (atached as Exhibit A), the\ngovernment’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the follouing reasons:\n\n= The government’s argument goes against the leter of the law.\n= The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law.\n= The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law.\n(Julie Opinion {ff 6-26).\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020179.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasas23F2ig ePagei7l65l8\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020187.jpg": "CaSedeZotepQo33ouAuNt Biscutreintl l7o2 lFiteb 83228 /2 49g PageoiS Ob l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national. If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2.

Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced.

Both counts require an intent to violate New\nYork law and cannot be based on any conduct that allegedly occurred in New Mexico (or any\nother state besides New York). The court’s answer to the jury’s question permits the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on alleged conduct occurring in New Mexico—aiding\nina return flight from New Mexico. Not only is that conduct not charged in the indictment (see\ndiscussion above), it also is not illegal under New York law. Under New York law, an intent to\nengage in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law,\nas charged in Counts Two and Four. See People v. Carvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL\n2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise criminal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>,\nsome alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).

For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised.\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting instruction as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony. Trial Tr. at\n2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774—75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on\nthe predicate state offense of New York law. The jury is presumed to have folloued these\ninstructions. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nAt botom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that\nthe jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in\nNew York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in\nNew Mexico.

Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021260.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E86 3536o38, Page88 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.”\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> or the victims’\nstatus as victims. The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals\n\nie The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.\nl3o Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation\nbut does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.

FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021312.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON B38. 3536o38, Pagel4o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 348\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes. ‘7°\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last!

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021323.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l49 3536o38, Pagel5l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021335.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel63 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s interest in prosecution, the other <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\n<span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021356.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel84 of 258\nSA-l82\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 348\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet resolution—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nUnder federal law, “whoever, in any mater within the <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3). The terms “knouingly and willfully’ mean that the subject acted with knouledge that\nthe conduct was, in a general sense, prohibited by law. It is not required that the subject was aware of the\nexistence of Section lool.\nUnder BOP standards of conduct discussed above, employees are required to cooperate fully with official\ninvestigations, which includes providing “all pertinent information they may have” and “truthfully responding\nto questions.”\nc Relevant BOP Policies Regarding the Operation of Correctional Facilities\nl. Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023559.jpg": "Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were “all for finding out the truth!\" To that end, they asked\nJudge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death.

It was reached, houever, with the clear and joint understanding\nthat the client would not be subjected to sex offender registration requirements in any state or :\nforeign <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span>, Moreover, the limited time provided did not allou for an opportunity to\nconduct an even cursory investigation or research into the ramifications. Were any charge to be\nbrought, having nou learned of the serious danger a plea to felony aggravated assault presents\nwith regard to sex offender registration, coupled with the facts presented at our meeting and\noutlined belou, we strongly believe that a plea to misdemeanor solicitation is the more\nappropriate resolution.

The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or <span class=\"highlight\">jurisdiction</span> for a sex offense.

The :\ngenetal public is certainly not aware of Florida’s unique nuanced definition. Indeed, as you will\nagree, in common usage, aggravated assault, on its face sounds inherently violent. Thus, at the\nvery least, most people will consider an aggravated assault charge, even of the “intent to commit\na felony” variety, to be a violent crime. In this regard, undifferentiated aggravated assault is one\nof only four critnes listed in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report “violent crime” category.’\n\nMore importantly, as noted, this crime clearly does not reflect what allegedly occurred\nsince there has been no suggestion that a threat of serous bodily harm was made or a deadly\nweapon used, In addition, most pleas are “dounward” — the defendant agrees to waive his right\nto trial in return for the prosecution's offer of a dounward departure in charging or sentencing. ;\nFurther, in the typical case a plea involves crimes that bear a close resemblance to the underlying\nevents. The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated assault, thus a plea to\nsame would be inappropriate.\n.

The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated assault, thus a plea to\nsame would be inappropriate.\n\n: The UCR divides its statistics into three major categories: violent crimes, property crimes, and hate crimes.\n“Violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and\naggravated assault.” “Violent Crime,” Crime in the United States, 2oo4, at\nhtp://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_o4/offenses_reported/violent_crime/index.html.\no7/26/l7 Page 2o of l3l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030541.jpg": "‘\n+. 3 ~\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE\nl5TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND\nFOR PALM BEACH COUNTY\nFLORIDA\nJANE DOE, by and through CASE NO:\nJANE DOE'S MOTHER as parent and natural\nguardian,\nj Plaintiffs,\nvs.\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY ROBSON,\nand SARAH KELLEN,\nDefendants.\n!\n: COMPLAINT\n; Plaimiffs, JANE DOE, by and through JANE DOE'S MOTHER as parent and natural\n| HALEY ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, and states as follous:\nParties, <span class=\"highlight\">Jurisdiction</span> and Venue\n| l.
