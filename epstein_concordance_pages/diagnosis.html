A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span>, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 35of 45\nl68 McElvaney\n\nHershkouitz I, Lanes O, Lamb ME. 2oo7.

Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion.

The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned.

As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of 29\n\nPathways to False Allegations 99\nbut not sufficient conditions for false allegations. There is no psychologi-\ncal <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span>, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). <span class=\"highlight\">Diagnosis</span> is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 29\n\nl22 J.

A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span>, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35of 45\nl68 McElvaney\n\nHershkouitz I, Lanes O, Lamb ME. 2oo7.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Bennet Gershman\n\nProfessor Gershman is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Elisabeth Haub School of\nLaw of Pace University since its founding as the Pace Law School in l976. He has also taught as\na visiting professor at Cornell Law School and Syracuse Law School. Prior to coming to Pace, he\nwas a prosecutor in the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office and the New York State Anti-\nCorruption Office. Professor Gershman’s extensive scholarship has had an essential role in\nestablishing the study of prosecutorial misconduct, a subject at the intersection of criminal\nprocedure and professional ethics. He is a leading authority on prosecutorial misconduct and the\nauthor of the treatise, Prosecutorial Misconduct, a preeminent resource for scholars and\npractitioners.\n\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best practices to ensure the\nintegrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation. His extensive experience and credentials are recited in\nhis curriculum vitae, annexed as Exhibit G.\n\nE. Robert Kelso\n\nMr. Kelso is CEO of Forensic Pursuit. He has over 25 years of experience in computer\nforensics, engineering and software technology. He holds Bachelor's and Master's degrees from\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder in aerospace engineering and astrodynamics, respectively. He\nis currently an adjunct professor at University of Denver teaching computer forensics at the\nMaster's level. He holds multiple computer forensics certifications including EnCE, CHFI, ACE\nand AME. His curriculum vitae is atached. Exhibit H. Mr. Kelso has previously testified in\nfederal and state courts as an expert witness in computer forensics and has been appointed a\n\"special master\" by the court on multiple occasions.\n\nWe anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the user data associated with certain\ndevices seized and searched by the government's team in this case, documents and photographs\nextracted from certain of those devices, and the metadata associated with certain documents and\nphotographs. He may also testify generally about computer forensic principles associated with\nthe creation of documents, storage and retrieval of digital documents and photographs, including\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lol of 375\n\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\n\nPage 39\n\n34.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

The testimony may be relevant to the jury’s\ndetermination of Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge because it could explain hou, for example, Ms.\nMaxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse but without any intent or knouledge of that\nresult. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion of nullification can be addressed with a\nlimiting instruction.\n\nThe Court will, houever, without a further shouing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.\nDietz from applying the halo effect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with\n“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders” that “alloued him to use\nhis brilliance to manipulate people.” Notice at 6-7. Dr. Dietz never met or examined Epstein\nbut instead bases this opinion on documents that he reviewed, including media interviews of\nEpstein, evidence from the Florida investigation of Epstein, and materials produced in this\nlitigation. Jd. at 6; Def. Br., Ex. l at l66-68. But neither Dr. Dietz nor the Defense has offered\nsupport for the claim that this is a reliable means by which an expert in Dr. Dietz’s field would\ndiagnose an individual. Typically, federal courts admit an expert <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> of a personality\ndisorder only if the expert personally interviewed the diagnosed individual. F.g., Tchatat v. City\nof New York, 3l5 F.R.D. 44l, 445-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6); United States v. Falcon, 245 F. Supp. 2d\nl239, l244 (S.D. Fla. 2oo3); see also Tardif 'v. City of New York, 344 F.

The Court would exclude Dr. Dietz’s <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> for much the same\nreasons that court identified. First, the Defense has offered no evidence that <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> without\nany in-person interview is a reliable and accepted method in Dr. Dietz’s field. /d. at 446.\nSecond, even if reliable, the opinion risks significant Rule 4o3 prejudice because the jury is\nlikely to overweigh Dr. Dietz’s <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span>. /d. at 447. Expert testimony may not act as a vehicle\nto “offer[ ] a narrative history” of the case to the jury or to simply “‘regurgitate’ the evidence”\nalready available in the record. Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l92\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). Instead, jurors may consider the applicability of the halo effect based on\nevidence in the record, including the anticipated testimony of multiple individuals that interacted\ndirectly with Epstein.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz expects to testify that because victims of sexual assault often develop\npost-traumatic stress disorder, they avoid situations and feelings that are likely to bring on\nsymptoms of PTSD, including contact with their abusers or wearing clothes gifted by their\nabusers. Notice at ll. The Defense explains that this testimony is relevant because it would\nmean that evidence of alleged victims interacting with Ms. Maxwell or Epstein after they have\nallegedly been abused is probative of whether their allegations of abuse are credible. Def. Br. at\nl5-l6. The Government argues that this opinion blames victims for their abuse, that it does not\nfit the facts of this case because the abuse was not accomplished by physical force, and that Dr.\nDietz does not have a reliable basis for the opinion. Gov’t Br. at 23-25.\n\nThe Court will admit this opinion. Dr. Dietz’s notice includes several citations to studies\nthat link victims of sexual abuse to PTSD, which the Court finds to be a reliable basis for the\nopinion. Notice at ll. The Government may of course cross-examine Dr. Dietz about contrary\nresearch.

In the most literal sense of the word, Epstein and Maxwell terrified\nme. They told me that if I told anyone, nobody would believe me and if they did, they would kill me\nand the people closest to me. I believed them. I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved life\nand people genuinely enjoyed being around me.

Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l).

The Government argues that Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony on psychological diagnoses is irrelevant and prejudicial under Rules 4ol and 4o3. The\nSecond Circuit has set out controlling case law to guide the Court’s decision:\n\nEvidence of a witness’s psychological history may be admissible when it goes to\n\nher credibility. In assessing the probative value of such evidence, the court\n\nshould consider such factors as the nature of the psychological problem, the\n\ntemporal recency or remoteness of the history, and whether the witness suffered\n\nfrom the problem at the time of the events to which she is to testify, so that it may\n\nhave affected her ability to perceive or to recall events or to testify accurately.\n\nUnited States v.

First, the report\nis nou over l2 years old. Courts in this circuit regularly find that diagnoses more than lo years\nold lack probative value. E.g., United States v. Bari, 75o F.2d ll69, ll79 (2d Cir. l984)\n(finding that more than lo years is too remote); United States v. Glover, 588 F.2d 876, 878 (2d\nCir. l978) (per curiam) (l2 years too remote); United States v. Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d 255, 264\n(E.D.N.Y. 2oll), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 7o6 F.3d l3l (2d Cir. 2ol3) (l3\nyears too remote); United States v.

See Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2.\n\nEven if any <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> were probative, the Court further finds that Rule 4o3 prejudice\noutweighs. First, the testimony may confuse jurors with old diagnoses that have litle connection\nto the conduct at issue or Alleged Victim 4’s credibility today. See id.

See Hernandez, 2oll WL\n2ll76ll, at *5. Third, mental health diagnoses are of a particularly sensitive nature and, if not\nrelevant, the witness’s privacy should not be invaded. Paredes, 2ool WL l4788lo, at *2 (citing\nIn re Doe, 964 F.2d l325, l328-29 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nAnd fourth, Dr. Hall’s testimony would be cumulative and cause undue delay.

Vitale, 459 F.3d at l96; Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (applying Vitale and Sasso).\nThe Court concludes that here, the cross-examination identified by the Government on Alleged\nVictim 4’s current medication for ae. along with lines of cross-examination\nunrelated to mental health, will provide the jury a sufficiently “discriminating appraisal” of\nAlleged Victim 4’s credibility such that Dr. Hall’s testimony and report is unnecessary.

The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative\nvalue of each of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged Victim 4 is substantially outweighed by the risk\nof unfair prejudice.\n\nBut this balancing of Rules 4ol and 4o3 is based on the present record. It is conceivable\nthat an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative value of a <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span>, such as\nthat mam 6—ti<i‘“‘—s~i‘;e‘~*@r would change the Court’s calculation.

Def. Br. at l2-l3 (collecting cases). The Second Circuit instructs:\n\nIt is, of course, within the proper scope of cross-examination to determine\n\nwhether a witness was under the influence of drugs or narcotics or alcohol at the\n\ntime of observation of events in dispute or at the time the witness is testifying. As\n\nWigmore points out, houever, a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of\n\nthe witness’s testimonial incapacity unless it involves actual intoxication at the\n\ntime of the event observed or at the time of testifying.\n\nUnited States v. DiPaolo, 8o4 F.2d 225, 229-3o (2d Cir. l986) (cleaned up) (cited in Gov’t Br.\nat ll and Def. Br. at l2); accord United States v.

Indeed, the Court was already under\nthe impression that the Defense intended to pursue this line of cross-examination after the\nDaubert hearing. Nov. lo Tr. at l57 (“[D]o you intend to impeach any witnesses based on\nsubstance abuse? .. . Yes.”).\n\nBut the extensive case law cited by the Defense about cross-examining witnesses on their\nsubstance use does not justify the request to admit Dr. Hall’s testimony on substance use and\na For example, in United States v. Vitale, the district court gave the defense “wide\nlatitude when cross-examining [the witness] about his drug use and rehabilitation, including\nquestions about the effects that the drugs had on his ability to perceive events when they\noccurred as well as on his memory at the time of trial.” 459 F.3d at l96. The district court did\nnot, houever, permit the defense to admit the witness’s drug rehabilitation treatment records into\nevidence. /d. Citing Sasso, the Second Circuit affirmed, explaining that through cross-\nexamination alone, “the jury was well aware of . . . [the witness’s] drug abuse and treatment\nhistory.” Jd. The Second Circuit has made such a distinction—permiting cross-examination on\ndrug use but excluding a formal <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> of| | several cases. E.g., DiPaolo, 8o4\nF.2d at 23o; Dobson v. Walker, l5o F. App’x 49, 52 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (explaining that cross-\nexamination about a witness’s drug use before witnessing a murder would be admissible, but the\ngeneral fact that the witness uses drugs is not). The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def. Br. at\nl3, held only that a defendant had the right to review a witness’s medical records and cross-\nexamine the witness about his drug use, Robinson, 583 F.3d at l27l-75.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pagel3oofl7\n\nIn addition to diagnosing Alleged Victim 4’s mental conditions, Dr. Hall also concluded\nThe Government moved to exclude this conclusion and the Defense does not make a case for\nadmiting it. The Court will also preclude the opinion. In this circumstance, the lasting mental\nimpact of a crime is at best “minimally probative” of whether that crime was commited. United\nStates v. Hendricks, 92l F.3d 32o, 329 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It also carries a high risk of Rule 4o3\nprejudice by suggesting that the psychological impact on Alleged Victim 4 is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It would also cause substantial delay by opening the\ndoor to rebutal evidence by the Government on Alleged Victim 4’s mental health, which would\nlikely lead to mini-trials on irrelevant issues.\n\nNext, the disclosure states that Dr. Hall will testify to the “significance” of Alleged\nVictim 4’s diagnoses. Notice at l2. First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current disclosure\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d. Dr. Hall’s report refers not only to what Alleged Victim 4 told him during their\nin-person interview but also other records like ee\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pagel4ofl7\n63. These out of court statements would be hearsay if admited for their truth, and so are\npresumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2. The Defense identifies several means by\nwhich it may admit these hearsay statements. Def. Br. at l4-l7.\n\nFirst, “[u]nder Rule 7o3, experts can testify to opinions based on inadmissible evidence,\nincluding hearsay, if ‘experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their\nopinions.’” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir. 2oo8). But Rule 7o3 does not\npermit an expert to “simply transmit that hearsay to the jury.” /d. Rather, those underlying facts\nand data that would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative\nvalue in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3. Here, the hearsay underlying Dr. Hall’s diagnoses, including\nPY would have litle probative value unless the\nGovernment were to challenge the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses. See United States v. Chai,\nNo. l3-CR-29o (PAC), 2ol5 WL 293995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2ol5). The Government\nrepresents in its brief that it would not do so in the event that Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are admited.\nGov’t Br. at l3. And admiting the underlying hearsay, without a relevant need to substantiate\nthe accuracy of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing\nthe jury and delaying the trial with a large volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore\nconcludes that, based on the parties’ current proffers, the facts and data underlying Dr. Hall’s\nopinions are not admissible via Rule 7o3.\n\nSecond, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements are admissible under one of\ntwo hearsay exceptions in Rule 8o3. Def. Br. at l5. It says the statements were statements of\nher “then-existing state of mind . . . or emotional, sensory, or physical condition.” Fed. R. Evid.\n8o3(3). But while a number of Alleged Victim 4’s statements to Dr. Hall may pertain to motives\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Pagel5ofl7\nor emotional condition, her statements made to Dr. Hall ing about events that took place\nyears earlier cannot be said to be “then-existing.” /d. The Defense also says Alleged Victim 4’s\nstatements were “made for medical <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> or treatment.” Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4). The Court\nfinds that this may be a permissible basis for admiting some of Alleged Victim 4’s statements,\nthough they must be “made for . . . medical <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> or treatment,” must “describe[ ] medical\nhistory; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and must\notherwise satisfy Rules 4ol and 4o3.

But without additional detail from the Defense on which\nportions of Dr. Hall’s testimony it would seek to admit under this exception, the Court cannot\nmake a definitive ruling.\n\nThe Defense does not mention Alleged Victim 4’s a cited by Dr. Hall in\nhis report. The Court concludes that Alleged Victim 4’s LF are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o9. Dr. Hall’s report is not clear on the details of Alleged Victim 4’s\nee\nes These incidents,\nhouever, are nou all over lo years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest act or false\nstatement,” and, for i. admiting the evidence is not necessary to fairly\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 6o9 (a), (b), (d).\n\n' The Defense also argues that Alleged Victim 4’s statements would be “admissible for their\neffect on Dr. Hall in forming his opinion.” Def. Br. at l5. But, like Rule 7o3, this justification is\na relevant basis for admission only if the validity of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses is put in question.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 24 of 228 7oo\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A.

Many of\nthose same operational challenges, including staffing\nshortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,\nfunctional security camera systems, and management\nfailures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review into the custody, care, and\nsupervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious\ninmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of\ninformation from the BOP that on August lo, 2ol9, in\nthe Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,\nNew York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged\nin his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\n\nCity of New York, determined that Epstein had died\nby suicide.\n\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.\nAmong other things, the FBI investigated the cause of\nEpstein’s death and determined there was no\ncriminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\n\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC\nNew York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of\nEpstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2ol9, until his\ndeath on August lo.\n\nEpstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7\n\nEpstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due\nto media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of\nhis notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated\nfrom general population inmates and kept locked in\ntheir cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at\nleast twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at\nleast one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also\nrequires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour\nperiod. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds\nenable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they\nare secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to\neliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU\nstaff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells\ndaily, and to search the entire SHU every week.\n\nOn July l8, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and\nordered him detained pending trial on the\ncriminal charges.\n\nIncident Involving Epstein on July 23\n\nWhile in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on\nnumerous occasions by psychological staff, including a\nformal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations\nhe denied having thoughts or a history of atempted\nsuicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not\nmeet the criteria for a psychological <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span>.\n\nOn July 23, at l:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO)\nresponded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found\nEpstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.\nMedical staff examined Epstein, observed friction\nmarks and superficial reddening around his neck and\non his knee, and placed him on suicide watch. BOP\npolicy requires that inmates identified as suicide risks\nbe placed on suicide watch until no longer at imminent\nrisk. The BOP uses a less restrictive monitoring form,\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23362", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023409.jpg": "Psychologist l noted that during Physician Assistant l’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,\nEpstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.\nAdditionally, Forensic Psychologist l noted no suicidal ideations, atempts, or self-harm; no history of\nsubstance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.\nDuring the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”\nand that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements.

He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating,\nand drinking within normal limits.\nUpon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shouer.

He furthered, \"I would not\ndo that to myself.\" Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than\nin the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be\nre-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU\nand asked if there were a \"safer\" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr.\nEPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-l3 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on\nPsychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for\none to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time.

Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological <span class=\"highlight\">diagnosis</span> and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements. Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate\n27 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,”\nnot “codes.”\n\n42\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027339.tif": "BP-AoS6a\nMULTI-LEVEL MORTALITY REVIEW U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nvon’ FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\na\nDate: o9/o9/2ol9\nTo: Office of Quality Management\nFrom: MCC New York Health Services\nSubject: Mortality Review for Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54\nInst: MCC-NY\nName: Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. #: 763l8-o54\nDOD: og/lo/2ol9 DOB: l/2o/l953 Age: 66 Sex: Male Race: White\nPlace of Death: — Inst. ¥.
