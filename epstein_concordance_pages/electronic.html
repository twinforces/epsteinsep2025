Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest.

Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl.

See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000322.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document7 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 3of3\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI, Reid Weingarten, hereby certify that on this date, July ll, 2ol9, a copy of the\nforegoing document has been served via <span class=\"highlight\">Electronic</span> Court Filing system on all registered\nparticipants.\n/s/ Reid Weingarten\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000330.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. <span class=\"highlight\">Electronic</span> monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Home Confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">Electronic</span> Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F.

A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance.

The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000416.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 2o Filed o7/l6/l9 Page ll of 24 ll\nj782epsC kjc\n\nl evidence from his home consistent with victim accounts.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000981.jpg": "Cds8°F:26-c BOBSSAU AND Se MEAL B Hilal EPAB?2O Pagees9 of 26o\nEB The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'°\n'6 Tn United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000997.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGvsnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage aB26lol9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient.

We believe these conditions are\nmore than sufficient to reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\n' As we argued in our initial bail application, this case involves the limited circumstance under which the Second\nCircuit approved granting pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that she pays for private armed security\nguards. United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (defendant who “is deemed to be a flight risk\nprimarily because of [her] wealth . . . may be released on such a condition only where, but for [her] wealth, [s]he\nwould not have been detained” (emphasis in original)).

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

(Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001171.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck I Ob 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001174.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagecs A Ob 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001228.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a geageol J G6 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n* See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI.

Together, these two motions present a unique and comprehensive bail package\nwith the strictest of conditions knoun in any bail application:\n\n= $28.5 million in bonds (including a $lM bond co-signed by a security\n\ncompany);\n\n= $9.5 million in real property;\n\n= $55o,ooo in cash;\n\n= Asset Monitoring by a retired federal district court judge;\n\n=\" Renunciation of British and French citizenship;\n\n= Irrevocable writen waivers of the right to contest extradition;\n\n=\" Surrender of all travel documents;\n\n= Home confinement in New York City;\n\n= <span class=\"highlight\">Electronic</span> GPS monitoring;\n\n= Jn-residence third-party custodian;7\n' Ms. Maxwell’s present motion (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.l6o) incorporates her Memorandum in Support of\nHer Renewed Motion for Bail and accompanying exhibits (Dkt. 97, including Atachments l-24) and her Reply\nMemorandum in Support of Her Renewed Motion for Bail (Dkt. lo3, including Atachments l-2) (collectively, the\n“Second Bail Motion’).\n2 To assist Ms. Maxwell in making up for lost time preparing for her upcoming trial, one of her lawyers (not trial\ncounsel) has agreed to reside with her and serve as an additional residential custodian.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001261.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiKRGS3S2e/Raghageor 6648\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001264.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ooBBQHANAt DOctMe rt l/2o 2 Filedeas/2o/PagPage aol66l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop.

The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001370.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 52, o4/l5/2o2l, 3o79olo, Page‘ of 2\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\ni a = =X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n- No. 2l-77o/2l-58\nAppellee, .\n—v.-\n* CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\na oo =X\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI certify that, on April l5, 2o2l, I caused a copy of the foregoing Notice of Motion and\nAffirmation to be served by this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> filing system on:\nMaurene Comey\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nMaurene.Comey@usdoj.gov\nLara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\nThomas McKay\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nThomas.McKay@usdoj.gov\nWon Shin\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nWon.Shin@usdoj.gov\nDOJ-OGR-ooool37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001391.jpg": "Castas2oicr-oo3BoAuNenDoCuitd h8 2o2 l FAeaMese5Ragerags 3of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”).

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice.

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ll) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (ll) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 24 of 26\n3. The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas aresult of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'®\n\"© In United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Jd. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l3 of l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized\ncitizen who was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum\nof 2o years’ imprisonment, and noting that <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369\nF.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nThe defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate\nfamily members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her\nsiblings, as her time in hiding makes clear, she is clearly capable of maintaining those relationships\nremotely, which of course she could continue to do from abroad.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal.

Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order § l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.!

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nreturns. The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> review\nplatform. The Government received the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J.

As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or\nreview any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n%* %* XK\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will\ncontinue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants disclosure in this case, including\nin connection with its production of Giglio and 35oo material.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nits outside vendor to image, stamp, and dounload that <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, which the Government\nfinished preparing for production last week, from an <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> database. The volume of that\nproduction is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that\nthe vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the\nGovernment has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2o2o deadline, and the vendor\nis making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next\nweek and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional\ntime beyond November 9 to finalize this production. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the\nGovernment has made numerous productions consistent with the discovery schedule in this case\nand is working diligently to continue to meet the discovery deadlines in this case.\n\nWith respect to the defense’s other claims and accusations, the Government is prepared to\nrespond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s accusations about\nthe Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally incorrect, but\nalso include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to\nreach agreement with the Government “[f]ollouing the close of discovery,” which has not yet\noccurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2o2o, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless\natempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule l6 discovery, or on a faulty\ndefinition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. l3, 2o2o,\nDtk. No. 4l, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of production of witness list until shortly before\ntrial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule l6 does not require\nproduction of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65, at l-2\n(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a\ndefendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the\nGovernment)).”\n\nWith respect to the Government’s October 7 leter regarding other agency files, the\ndefense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who\nit believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the\nGovernment has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more\nGovernment may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,\nthe Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.\n\n? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense nou contends that evidence\nabout the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Atorney’s Office\nfor the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense\nmakes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that\nagreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged\nin this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense\nnevertheless believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those\narguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.\n\n> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding\nany concerns about the Government’s October 7 leter or the Government’s planned productions\nprior to filing the Defense Leter with the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe production of a subset of the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\nproduction by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make.

In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool83o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 629 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthese materials come from devices seized from Epstein’s residences, and none of the devices is\nbelieved to have belonged to the defendant. Further, of the approximately l.2 million documents\nto be produced, only a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation\nthat led to the charges in the current Indictment, ' and the Government intends to produce those\ndocuments on November 9 with the rest of the sixth production. Additionally, as a result of the\nwork being completed by the vendor, these materials will be produced to the defense in a manner\nthat is readily sortable and searchable which should facilitate and expedite its review.\nThe Government therefore respectfully requests that the Court extend the deadline for\nproduction of documents being prepared by an outside vendor to November 23, 2o2o, and that the\nCourt similarly extend the motions schedule in this case by three weeks as requested by the\ndefense.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nThe Court hereby extends the deadline for the\nGovernment's production of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery\nSO ORDERED. ll/9/2o from November 9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o.\nThe Court also grants the parties’ request for an\nAvi (A ie extension of the motions deadlines as follous:\nthe Defendant's motions are due by January ll,\nAlison J.

STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page l2 of 9l l2\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl and federal law disclosure obligations.\n\n2 Go ahead, Ms. Moe.\n\n3 MS.

What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient.

(Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773 (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); United States v.\nBenatar, No. o2 Cr. o99 (JG), 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l9 of 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“Te]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4—88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document ll7 Filed ol/25/2l Page 2 of 3\nl MEN\nNe oN N U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\\ Bee |e N Federal Bureau of Prisons\nSs ae Sg) Hy Metropolitan Detention Center\n8o 29h Street\nBrooklyn, New York ll232\nJanuary 25, 2o2l\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Government agrees that no redactions are necessary\nas to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions\nto the remaining pre-trial motions for the follouing reasons:\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-\nprosecution agreement (Motion l) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment\ndelay (Motion 7) refer to documents designated by the Government as\n“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see\nProtective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation. See, e.g.,\nDouglas Oil Co. v.

The rule of grand jury\nsecrecy... is an integral part of our criminal justice system.’’).\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One through\nFour of the Superseding Indictment as time-barred (Motion 2) and her motion to\nstrike surplusage from the Superseding Indictment (Motion 6) protect the privacy\ninterests of victim-witnesses.\n\ne The proposed redactions to the motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six (Motion 4)\nrefer to documents designated by the Government as “Confidential” within the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Moreover,\nthe MDC computer shuts doun every two hours, requiring Ms. Maxwell to reboot the computer\nand find her place in the documents to resume her review. This process can take 2o-3o minutes,\nall of which is lost time. In addition, the pouer of central processing unit of the MDC computer\nis very slou. Uploading videos can take up to a half hour, time that cannot be used to review\nother documents. When the computer automatically shuts doun, videos need to be re-opened,\nrequiring Ms. Maxwell to locate the portion of the video she was viewing when the computer\nshut doun. In sum, using the prison computer is a problem, not a solution.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s review of discovery is challenging enough on the laptop computer that\nwas provided. Even with the laptop, Ms. Maxwell is unable to search, unable to print, and\nunable to tag or highlight documents for later review. She must review millions of pages of\nunwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at a time—with\nno filtering or organizing—and record millions of Bates numbers and notes of her review by\nhand on the limited amount of paper she is provided. And she is not permited to have any\nsupplies to organize the voluminous legal papers. Hard drives provided by the government have\nbeen mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to\nbecome degraded and unstable and to randomly shut doun. While the laptop does not solve all of\nthese issues, it performs far beter than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds\nexpended on problems caused by the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery and the computers is unnecessary,\nwasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -\nto challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counsel’s claim that she needs access to the laptop on the\nweekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents\nproduced in discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell’s access to her atorneys is a reason to deny her\naccess to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely\nnothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review discovery or\ncommunicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates.\nOther inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With exception of\ninmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited\ntime to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel,\nMs. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield pouer over her, overmanage\nher, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s opposition\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to\ncounsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized. The\npandemic has made the situation even more dire. Requiring pretrial detainees, including Ms.\nMaxwell, to review terabytes of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery on inadequate computers further tips an\nalready unlevel playing field to the detriment of criminal defendants.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo234o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974).

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Those\nredactions refer to and quote from portions of an exhibit filed under seal by the defense and which\nthe Government understands is filed under seal in Giuffre v.

Together, these two motions present a unique and comprehensive bail package\nwith the strictest of conditions knoun in any bail application:\n\n= $28.5 million in bonds (including a $lM bond co-signed by a security\n\ncompany);\n\n= $9.5 million in real property;\n\n= $55o,ooo in cash;\n\n= Asset Monitoring by a retired federal district court judge;\n\n=\" Renunciation of British and French citizenship;\n\n= Irrevocable writen waivers of the right to contest extradition;\n\n=\" Surrender of all travel documents;\n\n= Home confinement in New York City;\n\n= <span class=\"highlight\">Electronic</span> GPS monitoring;\n\n= Jn-residence third-party custodian;7\n' Ms. Maxwell’s present motion (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.l6o) incorporates her Memorandum in Support of\nHer Renewed Motion for Bail and accompanying exhibits (Dkt. 97, including Atachments l-24) and her Reply\nMemorandum in Support of Her Renewed Motion for Bail (Dkt. lo3, including Atachments l-2) (collectively, the\n“Second Bail Motion’).\n2 To assist Ms. Maxwell in making up for lost time preparing for her upcoming trial, one of her lawyers (not trial\ncounsel) has agreed to reside with her and serve as an additional residential custodian.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2782\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page /7ofl8\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Pageloofl8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop.

The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“[O]f the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2927\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4o of 348\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 2\nCe: \"StanPotinger@aol.com\" <StanPotinger@aol.com>, \"brad@pathtojustice.com\"\n<brad@pathtojustice.com>\nSubject: Virginia Guiffre\nAmanda,\nThank you again for meeting with us today.

That production, dated\nNovember l8, 2o2o, included approximately l.2 million documents (totaling approximately 2.2\nmillion pages), all of which are text searchable and were produced in a format conducive to loading\nthat production into a document review platform.? Moreover, the defense’s suggestion that it will\nneed to re-review every single page of discovery produced to date is, at best, hyperbolic. The\ndefense has already reviewed the discovery and presumably knous which portions relate in\n> To the extent the defense complains of recent difficulties reviewing certain Highly Confidential\nimages or other items that must be reviewed in the presence of federal agents, it bears noting that\nthe Government repeatedly informed defense counsel beginning in the fall of 2o2o that those\nmaterials would be made available for review upon request. The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior discovery productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o.

The\nGovernment has also agreed to provide notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), a\nproposed witness list, Jencks Act material, and Giglio material 45 days in advance of trial.

Further, the defense’s\nsuggestion that it has insufficient time to file additional motions is undercut by the proposed\nschedule agreed upon by the parties, which allous the defense to file its supplemental pretrial\nmotions more than five weeks after the return of the S2 Indictment and its motions in /imine more\nthan eight weeks from today and eleven weeks from the return of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAlthough the defense claims that its trial preparation will be hampered by the COVID-l9\npandemic, the availability of vaccines to all adults in the United States should enable the defense\nteam to conduct any necessary investigation far more expeditiously than was possible a few\nmonths ago.

See Rueb, 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (disclosure ordered where\ndefendant needed to review voluminous documentary evidence to prepare cross-examination).\nFourth, investigation of witness statements will face challenges and delays in light of the\ncontinuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-l9 pandemic and the reluctance of\nwitnesses to meet in person.\n\nBy contrast, the “possible dangers accompanying disclosure (i.e. subornation of perjury,\nwitness intimidation, and injury to witnesses)” are non-existent in this case.

Indeed, the government does not even atempt to argue that Ms. Maxwell, who is\ncurrently incarcerated, will atempt to threaten or intimidate witnesses if she is given their names.\nAccordingly, early disclosure of the identities of the government’s witnesses is warranted.\n\nFor these same reasons, the Court should order the government to provide early\ndisclosure of any and all evidence of “other acts” that it intends to introduce under Rule 4o4(b).\nThe allegations in the Indictment already include conduct that purportedly took place in locations\nall over the United States and in England. Moreover, the government just disclosed in its\nopposition that it intends to have Accuser-3 testify about Ps\n[| that are not alleged in the Indictment and that PO\nee\n| | (Opp. l59). The government may seek to introduce evidence of “other acts” that took\nplace in new locations and possibly other foreign countries.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 28 of 32 24\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl You'll do everything the probation officer tells you to do.\n\n2 You can't do anything the probation officer tells you you're\n\n3 not alloued to do.

As the Court may recall, on April l4, 2o2l, Mr.\nMarkus emailed Chambers requesting permission to bring electronics to the courthouse to atend\nthe defendant’s arraignment on the superseding indictment.

I have not been provided any of the trial discovery.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v. State Bar of\nNevada, 5ol U.S. lo3o, lo74 (l99l) (stating that “lawyers representing clients in\npending cases may be regulated” by substantial prejudice standard and not\nheightened general First Amendment standard of clear danger) (emphasis added); id.\nat lo76 (“The regulation of atorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that\nis substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect ... applying equally to all\natorneys participating in a pending case’) (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument. This was the only proceeding before this Court that I\nhave atended in person or on Zoom.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l9 _ Filed o8/l8/2l Page2of3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Counsel:\n\nPursuant to Rule l6(a)(l)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government\nhereby provides notice that it may call as an expert witness at trial Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a clinical\ninstructor of psychiatry and human behavior at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University.\nThe Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly provide\nnotice if the Government elects to do so.\n\nI. Disclosure by the Government\n\nDr. Lisa Rocchio is the President-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology of the\nAmerican Psychological Association (“APA”). Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since\nearning her Ph.D. in l995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School\nof Broun University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since\nshe entered private practice in l998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. In the last twenty-three years, Dr. Rocchio\nhas treated hundreds of victims of trauma, many of whom were minor victims of sexual abuse.\nDr. Rocchio has also received specialized training in traumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo565o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page7oflil\nthe package did not match the item. Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this\nmater is an unreliable mess.\n\nA. Message Pads\n\nThe Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations\nby the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as\nevidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits l through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages\nare undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to\nthis case, are outside the applicable time frame alleged in the indictment.\n\nB. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”\n\nThe search warrant inventory identifies numerous <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> storage devices as having\nbeen seized. Houever, no actual inventory of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have\nbeen prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department. The items were not identified by\nhard drive name or number or photo. Accordingly, there exists no way for anyone to accurately\nidentify what content may have been on any particular device and hou that device may or may\nnot relate to any issue in this case.\n\nC. Photos\n\nThe inventory also lists the seizure of “Photos.” Many of the photos are not identified\nwith any particularity.\n\nII. The Proposed Evidence Is Inadmissible Because of a Lack of Authenticity\nand Personal Knouledge\n\nEvidence may be authenticated through direct or circumstantial proof. United States v.\nAl-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). “The chain of custody is ordinarily a method of\nauthentication for physical evidence.” United States v.

There is no nexus between any allegation in this case and the photograph.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 6o6 is a document titled “Household Manual” which was apparently\nprinted from an unidentified computer or other <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> storage device. There is no evidentiary\nfoundation for this document, it is hearsay, and the one date on the document, “2/l4/2oo5,”\nsuggests that it was created after the events alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell did not create\nthe document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did.\n\nII. The Items are Not Relevant\n\nRule 4ol defines relevant evidence as that which “has any tendency to make a fact more\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence,” so long as “the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol; see also Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl78 (l997).\n\nThere is no evidence that any accuser in this case saw, was aware of, or impacted by any\nof the above listed item. ll\nEE\nSimilarly, the apparent seizure of the “Twin Torpedos” in 2oo5 is not probative of anything.\n\nPhotographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2ol9 prove no material fact in this\ncase not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed belou.\n\nFinally, the unauthenticated 2oo5 “Household Manual” is outside the time frame alleged\nin the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment.\n\nIll. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial\n\n“The term ‘unfair prejudice,’ as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some\n\nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5779\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act production—\nand specifically, the Government’s production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5846\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this\nmater is an unreliable mess.\n\nA. Message Pads\n\nThe Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations\nby the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as\nevidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits l through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages\nare undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to\nthis case, are outside the applicable time frame alleged in the indictment.\n\nB. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”\n\nThe search warrant inventory identifies numerous <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> storage devices as having\nbeen seized. Houever, no actual inventory of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have\nbeen prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department.

There is no nexus between any allegation in this case and the photograph.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 6o6 is a document titled “Household Manual” which was apparently\nprinted from an unidentified computer or other <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> storage device. There is no evidentiary\nfoundation for this document, it is hearsay, and the one date on the document, “2/l4/2oo5,”\nsuggests that it was created after the events alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell did not create\nthe document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did.\n\nII. The Items are Not Relevant\n\nRule 4ol defines relevant evidence as that which “has any tendency to make a fact more\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence,” so long as “the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol; see also Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl78 (l997).\n\nThere is no evidence that any accuser in this case saw, was aware of, or impacted by any\nof the above listed items. [nn\nHE Regardless, the photographs are not probative of any material fact in this case.\nSimilarly, the apparent seizure of the “Twin Torpedos” in 2oo5 is not probative of anything.\n\nPhotographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2ol9 prove no material fact in this\ncase not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed belou.\n\nFinally, the unauthenticated 2oo5 “Household Manual” is outside the time frame alleged\nin the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment.\n\nIII. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial\n\n“The term ‘unfair prejudice,’ as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some\n\nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different\na\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6698\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def.

Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial.

Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

In the absence of standardized questionnaires\nKiteley and Stogdon’s (2ol4) systematic review framework or disclosure instruments, telling emerges as a practical term\nwas utilized to establish what has been investigated in CSA more readily understood by study participants.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to request a\nclarification of the Court’s instructions regarding the use of paper documents versus <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\ndocuments at trial. In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will be permited to display\ndocuments used for impeachment or refreshing a witness’s recollection in <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> format solely on the\nvideo screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s deputy, or whether we will be required to\nprovide paper copies of these materials, even if the materials do not reference a witness who is testifying\nunder a pseudonym. !\n\nThe defense is sensitive to the Court and the government’s concerns that people siting in the\ngallery of the courtroom do not see any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under\npseudonyms. We also understand that the Court wants to ensure that the witnesses will have access to\nthe complete documents that may be used for impeachment and refreshing recollection, rather than a\n' Counsel for the defense understood the discussion on November 23, 2o2l, to apply only to documents which\ncontained identifying information for witnesses who are testifying under pseudonyms or first names. The\ngovernment, houever, has suggested that paper documents need to be used for all impeachment and refreshing,\nwhether or not the documents contain such identifying information.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5ll Filed ll/27/2l Page 2 of 3\nparticular page. We have considered these concerns and would like to propose a solution that we\nbelieve will address these issues and safeguard the privacy interests of the witnesses, and at the same\ntime provide for an efficient trial and protect Ms. Maxwell’s rights.\n\nThe defense proposes that the parties be permited to display documents used for impeachment\nor refreshing recollection only on the video screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s\ndeputy. None of these screens face the gallery or the jury box and cannot be seen by anyone in the\naudience or by members of the jury. The documents will not be displayed on the screens at counsel\ntable, which face the gallery, or on the juror screens.\n\nWhile the defense may display a particular page of a document to the witness to impeach or\nrefresh recollection, we will have the complete document available in <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> form. If the witness\nwishes to see other pages of the document, we can display those pages on the witness’s screen at the\nwitness’s request. Most importantly, this process will allou counsel to highlight or direct the witness’s\natention electronically to particular sections of the 35oo materials, without having to describe the\nparticular paragraph number or sentence in (sometimes) voluminous, dense, multi-page FBI 3o2 reports.\nAdditionally, it will ensure that the witness is looking at the correct exhibit, rather than at other potential\nimpeachment material in a binder before them, especially since defense counsel is not placed in a\nposition within the courtroom that permits us to see what exhibit or page the witness has open in front of\nthem on the witness stand. Finally, it will obviate the need to approach a witness, which is difficult with\nthe Covid protocols and courtroom set-up, to direct the witness to a particular exhibit or section of an\nexhibit.\n\nThe government has advised that it does not require copies of any of the 35oo materials or the\ngovernment exhibits. If the defense uses any documents to impeach or refresh recollection that are not\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document532 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

We respectfully request leave from the Court\nto file a brief amicus curiae on the issue of the impact of the post-trial revelations and admissions from\nJuror # 5o on whether the Defendant in this case received the guaranteed right to a fair trial and what relief\nis required. Specifically, NACDL would address the increased importance of writen or oral voir dire in\nhigh-profile criminal cases and/or those with sensitive issues central to a case that could reflect a juror’s\nbias or potential for extraneous issues being brought into jury deliberations, the impact of inaccurate\nanswers to questions asked to expose potential bias for further questioning and the exercise of strikes,\nwhether and when a court should consider the deliberateness in a potential juror providing inaccurate\ninformation and the process by which such issues should be explored once they have been disclosed.\n\nIn support of this request to file a brief amicus curiae, proposed amici state the follouing:\n\nl. NACDL is a nonprofit voluntary professional bar association made up of and working on\nbehalf of criminal defense atorneys to ensure justice and due process for those accused of crime or\nmisconduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service.

The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.! That alone strongly weighs in favor of permiting the redactions\nand sealed filings at issue: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n‘To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\nApp.o95\nDOJ-OGR-oool9554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019677.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document lo4-l, lo/l9/2o2o, 29552o6, Pagel of 4\n2o-3o6l\nUnited States v.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019899.jpg": "Cas 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DStamteHPl &-Pitdd BPP POH Page DS St 2o\nEB The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'°\n'6 Tn United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019915.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL8) 26a deanfect 2 GP l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v.

The notion that we\n6 would be able to in any meaningful way review these with our\n\n7 client to prepare the case for motion and for trial under the\n8 current pandemic situation is just not realistic.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

This production includes documents and images seized from <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices found at\nEpstein’s residences in searches of his residences in 2ol9.

(Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020092.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBtlANt BEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPageB26af 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020146.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagel bof 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020158.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN ZetuMAent /LOO l FileasaesFaigePagd Bast 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n2 See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance.

Together, these two motions present a unique and comprehensive bail package\nwith the strictest of conditions knoun in any bail application:\n\n= $28.5 million in bonds (including a $lM bond co-signed by a security\n\ncompany);\n\n= $9.5 million in real property;\n\n= $55o,ooo in cash;\n\n= Asset Monitoring by a retired federal district court judge;\n\n=\" Renunciation of British and French citizenship;\n\n= Irrevocable writen waivers of the right to contest extradition;\n\n=\" Surrender of all travel documents;\n\n= Home confinement in New York City;\n\n= <span class=\"highlight\">Electronic</span> GPS monitoring;\n\n= Jn-residence third-party custodian;7\n' Ms. Maxwell’s present motion (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.l6o) incorporates her Memorandum in Support of\nHer Renewed Motion for Bail and accompanying exhibits (Dkt. 97, including Atachments l-24) and her Reply\nMemorandum in Support of Her Renewed Motion for Bail (Dkt. lo3, including Atachments l-2) (collectively, the\n“Second Bail Motion’).\n2 To assist Ms. Maxwell in making up for lost time preparing for her upcoming trial, one of her lawyers (not trial\ncounsel) has agreed to reside with her and serve as an additional residential custodian.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020179.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasas23F2ig ePagei7l65l8\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020182.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQ)C3GouAUNt Besutrent! l7o2 lF ib 83228/2 49 Piageoid Ob l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\nmonitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop. Her receipt of legal mail — including pretrial motions, responses and replies\n—are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC. The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic. The alternative — to meet in the open-area where social visiting had been conducted-\naffords no privacy for confidential atorney-client communication, especially under constant oversight by Ms.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020183.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQC3GouAUNt Besutrent! l7o2 lF ib 832238 /2 49 Piageoci l Ob l8\nConclusion\nThe Court should grant bail for Ms. Maxwell on the extraordinary conditions\n\nproposed.

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span>\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020288.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 7l, o4/l5/2o2l, 3o79olo, Pagel of 2\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\ni a = =X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n- No. 2l-77o/2l-58\nAppellee, .\n—~v.- :\n* CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\na oo =X\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI certify that, on April l5, 2o2l, I caused a copy of the foregoing Notice of Motion and\nAffirmation to be served by this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> filing system on:\nMaurene Comey\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nMaurene.Comey@usdoj.gov\nLara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\nThomas McKay\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nThomas.McKay@usdoj.gov\nWon Shin\nAssistant United States Atorney\nl St. Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nWon.Shin@usdoj.gov\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020309.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tra S3osaTentDGcWAerW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, 57Age Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020317.jpg": "Cas6ds2®@ treo 32os Agen (DGcWmere/297l, RRWDA3M 7abePage Dot 5\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Br., Ex. l (\"Notice\"). Two of\nthose experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions\nthat rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The\nGovernment on November 8, 2o2l, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony\nof Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that\nmotion. On November l5, 2o2l, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude\nthe testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November\nl9, 2o2l. The Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate writen\nopinion. In this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennet\nGershman based on the parties' current proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion\n& Order ***]... TI. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's motion\nto preclude Gershman's expert testimony.

Br., Ex. l (\"Notice\"). Two of\nthose experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions\nthat rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The\nGovernment on November 8, 2o2l, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony\nof Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that\nmotion. On November l5, 2o2l, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude\nthe testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November\nl9, 2o2l. The Court addresses the motion to preclude Dr. Hall in this separate opinion.\nIt will address the other five experts in public rulings....[*** See this Memorandum\nOpinion & Order ***]... III. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's\nmotion to preclude Dr. Hall's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial\nruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's\nanalysis. In that event, the Defense must re—raise its request to admit Dr. Hall as an\nexpert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

Its\nconclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must:\n(l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court\nconcludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common\nlaw presumptions of access atach. But in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has\nput forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third\nparties referenced in the documents, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the\nCourt noted at the November l conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a\nspecific employer, but the type and genre of employment may be relevant to the jury's\nassessment of credibilty.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021941.jpg": "Do Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document8 Filed ll/l9/l9 Page lo of lo\n|\n- DOCKET No. l9 Cr 83o (AT) DEFENDANT Michael Thomas |\nAUSA Nicolas Roos DEF.’$ COUNSEL Montel Figgins\nWireranep (I) FEDERAL DEFENDERS Licia CI presENTMENT ONLY\nOo INTERPRETER NEEDED\nC] DEFENDANT WAIVES PRETRIAL REPORT\nORule5 ORule9 O Rule 5(c)3) l Detention Hrg.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\n<span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023439.tif": "and then she heard Thomas rip something. Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his\narms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him doun on the ground to perform CPR.\nAccording to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cuter she hit the body alarm, which is a\nbuton on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she\nwould have knoun if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did. She also said that\nthere was no indication that any of the inmates could have goten out of their cells. Noel said she never\nslept during her shift on August 9-lo, 2ol9. Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not\nmoving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading\nup to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; houever, she caught herself and never slept.\nThe Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 5:3o a.m. The Lieutenant said that at\napproximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to\nthe alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher. The Electronics Technician said he and Senior\nOfficer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being\ntransported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.*?

The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and\nuntil approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said\nhe delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same\non another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food\nto the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU\nOfficers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs shou, among other things, Epstein on his back with an\nintravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him\nwearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York shou Epstein in\na hospital goun, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital which shou Epstein in a hospital goun.\nAdditionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at\nthe time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of\nsight to Epstein’s cell.4* One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from\nEpstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side\nof L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, a litle before l2 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.\nInmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning\nof August lo prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August lo. Inmate 5 said the male\nCO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see\nEpstein’s legs from the knee doun but could tell that Epstein was laying doun on his back because his feet\nwere pointed upward. The male CO bent doun to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The\nmale CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said\nboth the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said\nthat once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest\ncompressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the\nfemale CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the buton. The female officer said,\n“Yeah, a long time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to\n#8 As noted previously, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the\ninmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.\n\n73\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2344o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023443.jpg": "According to a memorandum atached to the Form 583 from the Correctional Systems Officer dated\nAugust lo, 2ol9, after Noel called the medical emergency, the Correctional Systems Officer received a call\nfrom staff in the SHU instructing her to call 9ll for an ambulance. The Correctional Systems Officer notified\nthe New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York institutional NYPD telephone. The\nCorrectional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical\nassistance for one of the inmates. The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at\n6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein\nand a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:lo a.m.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant\nprior to 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and\nLieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift. At some point, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she\nknew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done. The Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate\nmeals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the\nmeals were delivered, she finished up and went home.\nAll MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any\ninformation suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts. Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and\naccountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have\nfound a way to do so.\nB. Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August lo Follouing His Death\nFollouing Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell.

The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\nretrieved from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.\n\n5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to\nseveral days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.\n83\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg": "the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift\nended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the institution the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023452.tif": "Only two cameras in the vicinity of the SHU area were recording to DVR l at the time of Epstein’s death.”\nOne camera was located on the upper-level entrance to the lo South Unit, a housing unit adjacent to the\nSHU, near the door MCC New York staff referred to as the “46 door.” That camera captured video of a large\npart of the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways\nleading to the different SHU tiers, including the tier containing Epstein’s cell. Thus, anyone entering or\natempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU on August 9 and lo would have been\npicked up by the video recorded by that camera. Epstein’s cell door, houever, was not in that camera’s field\nof view. The other camera that was recording was located in one of the ninth floor’s two elevator bays and\nprovided video of the ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor’s four elevators.\nThe available video shoued that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted touard the\nL Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge. At approximately\nlo:39 p.m., an unidentified CO appeared to walk up the L Tier stairway, and then reappeared within view of\nthe camera at lo:4l p.m. This is believed to be the last time anyone entered L Tier before approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo. Between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:3o a.m. on\nAugust lo, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU\ntiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas's admissions to the OIG\nthat the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame. At approximately 6:28 a.m., an\nunidentified officer was observed on the L Tier stairway, presumably to deliver breakfast food trays.\nBetween 6:28 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., an unidentified officer, believed to be Noel, moved back and forth several\ntimes between the L Tier stairway and the SHU Officers’ Station. At approximately 6:33 a.m., additional\nofficers entered the SHU and ascended the L Tier stairway, presumably after Noel activated her body alarm\nwhen Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell.\nAs noted above, the camera at the end of the L Tier was providing a live video feed at the time of Epstein’s\ndeath but the video was not being recorded. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that certain MCC\nNew York personnel, including the Control Center, SIS personnel, the Warden, most Lieutenants, and the\nElectronics Technician, had access to the live video feed of the institution’s security cameras. He explained\nthat to view the live feed of a particular camera an employee with access would need to key in the specific\ncamera into the security camera system to call up the live feed. The Correctional Systems Officer, who was\nworking in the Control Center on August lo from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant both told the OIG that the only live feed from the SHU on their screens was video from the\ncamera shouing the SHU common area, and they did not perceive a need to take the necessary steps to see\nthe live feed from the SHU L Tier from either of their duty stations on the evening Epstein died.\n53 One additional camera located at the lo South Officers’ Station was recording on August lo, 2ol9. That camera is not\ndepicted in Figure 4.l2 because neither the SHU nor the SHU entrances were within the field of view of that camera.\n“4 The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the lo South Unit to be of lou quality. Due to the\nvideo's lou quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe\nmovement of individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively identify the individuals. The OIG was\nalso not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera\nonly captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers. The OIG found that movements captured on the\nvideo were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented\nin BOP records.\n\n85\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023459.jpg": "Figure 6.7\nLocation of Non-Recording Camera in the L Tier of the SHU\na\noe\n* ZA >, a | } / Non-Recording : |\nl nf EES, , stein’s\nSource: DOJ OIG schematic drawing depicting the MCC New York SHU and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\nCity of New York\nThe Warden, who was not scheduled to work on August lo, 2ol9, arrived at the institution later that\nmorning after being notified of Epstein’s death and was informed that most of the cameras in the SHU were\nnot recording. He told the OIG that when the SIS Lieutenant arrived at the facility that morning, he informed\nher that the SHU cameras had not been recording, and the SIS Lieutenant explained that the hard drive\nissue had been detected on August 8. He told the OIG that prior to August lo, he was unaware that the\nDVR 2 issue had been detected on August 8, and that approximately half of the facility's cameras, and in\nparticular the cameras in the SHU, were found to not be recording on that date.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the Warden had instructed Electronics Technician to try and\nrecover any potential SHU video that may have been recorded by the cameras assigned to the\nmalfunctioning DVR 2 system, but the Electronics Technician was unable to find anything. The Electronics\nTechnician further said that the Warden wanted to have all the facility's cameras recording again as soon as\npossible, so he instructed the Electronics Technician to begin repairing DVR 2.\nD. FBI Forensic Analysis of the DVR System\nFBI evidence documents revealed that on August lo, 2ol9, the FBI seized all hard drives contained within\nthe DVR 2 system. On August l4, 2ol9, the FBI returned to MCC New York and seized additional DVR 2\ncomponents. On August l5, 2ol9, the FBI seized the entire DVR l system.\n92\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023460.jpg": "The FBI's Digital Forensics Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, received MCC New York's DVR system on\nAugust l6, 2ol9, and began to conduct a forensic analysis of the system. According to FBI forensic reports,\nDVR 2 did not start successfully. The Digital Forensics Analysis Unit found that the system contained three\nfaulty hard drives. The FBI forensic reports state that the three drives were repaired by an FBI Advanced\nData Recovery Specialist, but the DVR was never able to be assembled successfully. The forensic reports\nfurther state that an FBI computer scientist and the Company l Technician reviewed the DVR 2 controller\nlogs and found that there had previously been “catastrophic disk failures” and no recordings would have\nbeen available after July 29, 2ol9.\nWhen the OIG asked the Electronics Technician about this finding by the FBI, he told the OIG he was\nunaware that cameras were not recording to DVR 2 between July 29 and August 8, 2ol9. Neither the\nWarden nor the SIS Lieutenant was aware the cameras assigned to DVR 2 had not been recording since\nJuly 29, 2ol9. The Company l Technician could not recall working with the Electronics Technician on any\nDVR issues prior to August 8, 2ol9, but he said that if the entire DVR 2 server went doun on July 29, 2ol9, no\nvideo would have been able to have been retrieved from that point forward from any of the cameras\nrecording to DVR 2.\n\n93\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023466.tif": "resulted in Epstein being housed without a cellmate at the time of his death, which was contrary to the\nPsychology Department's directive issued just lo days earlier.\nBOP standards of conduct require that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”©' MCC\nNew York Post Orders for the SHU require, among other things, that all SHU officers “maintain a log of\npertinent information regarding inmate activity, detailing time, persons involved (if pertinent) and the event,\nwhich must be logged into TRUSCOPE.”® Importantly, the SHU Post Orders clarify that they “are not\nintended to describe in detail all the officer's responsibilities. Good judgment and common sense are\nexpected in all situations not covered in these post orders.”\nOn August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and CO\nTova Noel were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly assigned post and\nserved as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts. The OIG investigation found that each\nof these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology\nDepartment's directive.\nThe OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s\ncellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status knoun to all\nMCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the\ninstitution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and CO l, who was also assigned to the SHU, reviewed the MCC New York daily call out list,\na document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, which listed Inmate 3\nas being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings. At approximately 8:3o a.m., CO l\nescorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the\nDay Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for his\ndaily meeting with his atorneys. During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO l\ndiscussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer. The Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared follouing Epstein’s death,\nthat he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new\ncellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant. Houever, the OIG did not credit the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in\nfact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.\n6 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n62 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an <span class=\"highlight\">electronic</span> event log.\n& Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9.\n6 Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave\nthe facility.\n6 The OIG did not find that CO l failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-\nof-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\n\n99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.
