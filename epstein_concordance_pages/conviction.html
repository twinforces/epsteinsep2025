BACKGROUND !\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and\ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage\ngirls. Starting in l994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to\nengage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual\ntopics and sexual abuse.

Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to transport a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan essential ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 28l9, 2327\n(2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the ques-\ntion, the Second Circuit has strongly suggested that\nMaxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v.\nUnited States, 865 F.3d 48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the\nSecond Circuit discussed at length hou the text,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000127.jpg": "64a\ncontext, and history of § 3283 shou that Congress\nintended courts to apply the statute using a case-\nspecific approach. The Third Circuit reached the same\nconclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl96 (8d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the\nreasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> contexts of criminal sentencing\nand immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for application of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Id. at 59. “The language of § 32838,\nby contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That\nlinguistic expansion indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case. This reading accords with a robust\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000128.jpg": "65a\nlegislative history indicating that Congress intended\nto apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against\nchildren. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o; Schneider,\n8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach\ndo not apply here either. For statutes dealing with\nprior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves\n‘practical’ purposes: It promotes judicial and adminis-\ntrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past\nconvictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact.”\nMoncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3). In\nthe context of § 3283, there is no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> to\nassess, and the jury will determine in the first instance\nwhether “the defendant engaged in the applicable\nabusive conduct.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell\nnonetheless contends that using a _ case-specific\napproach for § 3283 would be impractical because the\nGovernment would need to prove conduct beyond the\nelements of the offense. It may be true that this\napproach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense\npresents factual issues (including, at least, when the\nalleged conduct took place). This is not a serious\npractical problem and does not justify seting aside the\nstatute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States,\n346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this Court to cast\nWeingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges\naddressed a statute that extended the limitations\nperiod for defrauding the United States during the\nSecond World War. In that case, the Supreme Court\nfirst concluded that making false statements at an\nimmigration hearing was not subject to the extended\nlimitations period because it lacked any pecuniary\nelement as required by the statute. Id. at 22l. Then, as\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000146.jpg": "83a\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court\nwill follou the well-worn path of others in this District\nand reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her\nmotion then.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous\n\ncharges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third\ncount of the $l superseding indictment as multiplicitous\nis also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government\nhas alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a\nsingle offense as an offense multiple times, in separate\ncounts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been\ncommited.” United States v.

And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y.

Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l.

Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000331.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 3of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9.

Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000348.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page6oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 6\nMultiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information\nagainst the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely\nthe presumptions and the § 3l42(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be\ndetained.”’).\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000373.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document l4 Filed o7/l5/l9 Page 8 of l8 |\n| | SORA HEARING page7\n‘oS l a He is registered in the U.S. Virgin Islands, he )\n| . | 2 has been since his release from jail.

In the fall of 2oo7, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”)\nwith the Southern District of Florida in connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation,\nwhich the non-prosecution agreement identified as including investigations into the defendant’s\nabuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area.” Id. at 3. “In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in\n[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a\nfelony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony. As a result, the defendant :\nwas designated as a sex offender with registration requirements under the national Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act.” Id.\nThe Defense moved on July ll, 2ol9, for pretrial release of Mr. Epstein, arguing that\n“Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various monitoring requirements associated with his\nsex-offender registration actually decrease[s] any danger that he might otherwise pose” and also\nthat “Mr. Epstein has never once atempted to flee the United States.’ Dkt. 6 at l, l2.

This principle originated in the English common\n\n7 law. It was adopted by most U.S. federal courts, but more\n\n8 recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism. The rule of\n9 abatement is best explained in the Second Circuit case of\n\nlo U.S. v. Wright.\n\nll In that Wright case, two defendants had pled guilty to\nl2 embezzlement and tax evasion. Both defendants appealed, but\n\nl3 one of the defendants died while his appeal was pending in the\nl4 Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule\nl5 of abatement, the judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against the deceased\nl6 defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to\nl7 be dismissed. The Wright court held that when a convicted\n\nl8 defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending,\nl9 his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had\n2o during the course of the prosecution.\n2l The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that\n22 when a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> abates upon the death of a\n23 defendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with\n25 respect to associated forfeiture orders.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo646", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000647.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 9 of 86 9\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl This later application of the rule of abatement\n\n2 regarding forfeiture has not been universally accepted among\n\n3 federal courts, but it certainly is the law in this circuit.\n\n4 Some of you may be interested to knou that some United States\n\niy courts, state courts, have criticized the rule of abatement,\n\n6 particularly in the face of grouing recognition of victims'\n\n7 rights in the criminal justice system, including the Crime\n\n8 Victims' Rights Act.\n\n9 It has been writen and contended in the Brooklyn Law\nlo Review -- I can give you the cite later -- that when courts\n\nll abate criminal convictions, they reimpose a burden on victims\nl2 that legislatures intended to alleviate through these victim\n\nl3 rights statutes. The state Supreme Court has even concluded\n\nl4 that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides\nl5 the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of\n\nl6 abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and\nl7 its constitution nou require the criminal justice system to\n\nl8 accommodate the rights of crime victims. Further, that the\n\nl9 abatement of criminal convictions has important implications\n2o for these rights.\n2l But coming back to our case, which is what you are\n22 concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude\n23 that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant\n24 as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the\n25 Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo647", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000648.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page lo of 86 lo\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\n2 So that's just some background I wanted to share with\n3 you.

The facts\nstrongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms. Maxwell—who was\nnot named in the Epstein indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in\ntheir custody.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence.

The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein.

Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001299.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage GF 6656\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember.

Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001333.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel6 of 25\nCir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n3l. This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9). It reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight\nand whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v.

It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell.

Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation.

She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Gzuffre\nv. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3.

United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc, 5ll U.S. 863, 867—\n68 (l994) (internal quotation marks and citations omited).

The main effect of a decision by a requested person to consent to extradition is that the overall extradition\nprocedure is substantially shortened. In the context of US extradition cases, this means that removal can\ntake place within months, sometimes weeks, as compared to the longer timescales considered above.\n\nC. Bail in extradition cases\n\n2o. Where extradition is sought for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person for an offence, the person\nhas the same right to bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proceedings, namely there is a presumption\nthat bail will be granted unless one of the exceptions in Schedule | to the Bail Act l976 applies”’. The\nthree exceptions in Schedule l that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are\nsubstantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to\ncustody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the\ncourse of justice®®.\n\n2l. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as\nmany of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature\nand seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and\ncommunity ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of\ntheir obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence\nagainst the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental\ninjury to another person.\n\n22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an indication as to the\nway in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice. In all five cases bail was refused”.\n\n“ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. l28(4).\n\n*’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s.95(2). The principle of specialty is a rule of extradition law that is intended to ensure that an\n\nextradited person is not dealt with in the requesting state for any offence other than that for which they have been\n\nextradited.\n\n“© Extradition Act 2oo3, ss. loo(2), lo3(2) and lo8(2).\n\n“’ Bail Act l976, s. 4(2A).

As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD. The bars to extradition that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face extradition to\n\nthe US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n24.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)).

Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o)).\n\nWhere ambiguity exists on the questioner's part, the test is whether the question, as the\ndeclarant objectively understood it, is falsely answered. Perjury does not exist by implication.\n\nA jury should not be permited to engage in conjecture of whether any unresponsive\n\nanswer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the\n\nexaminer; the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it bears\n\non whether he does not believe his answer to be true.\nBronston v.

The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002802.jpg": "l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE D ment l73 ‘Filed o3/| fl\nCase Cc ocument ed o3/ 42d PeBRAO\nCriminal Notice of Appeal - Form A DOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nNOTICE OF APPEAL DOC #:\nUnited States District Court DATE FILED: 3/24/2o2l\nSouthern District of New York\n\nCaption:\nUnited States of America _\n\n2o-CR-oo33o-AJN\nGhislaine Maxwell Docket Nou: nana\nRae Alison J.

Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit.

United States, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the\ncriteria for applying the categorical approach are met in the context of Section 3283. Jd. The\ncategorical approach—which focuses on the elements of the offense—is generally only used in\nsetings like sentencing and immigration, where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. /d. at 59. In such a context, a court atempting to examine the facts of the prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> to determine the present punishment or immigration consequences would encounter\nlogistical and constitutional obstacles. /d. (noting an Apprendi problem and “daunting practical\ndifficulties and potential unfairness”). None of those concerns is present here, where the relevant\nfacts will be proved at trial.\n\nThe Weingarten court also specifically rejected the argument Maxwell nou asserts: that\nthe words “offense involving” require a categorical approach. “[T]hat Congress used the word\n‘involving’ in § 3283 does not necessarily mean it intended to trigger the categorical approach.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ooo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6/7 of 239\n‘Involving’ .. . is equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” 865 F.3d at 6o n.ll\n(citing Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 38 (2oo9) (applying the circumstances-specific approach\nto a statute containing the word “involves”)). Moreover, as the Weingarten court observed, the\nSupreme Court has applied the categorical approach to statutes containing the word “involving”\nwhere the statutes at issue also referenced “elements” of offenses, or specific prior “convictions,”\nin a manner that referred to specific convictions, as opposed to particular offense conduct. 865\nF.3d at 59 (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (l99o); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l\n(2oo4)). By contrast, the phrase “sexual abuse” in Section 3283 refers to specific conduct, and not\nthe statutory offenses charged in the Indictment.\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit further noted that applying the categorical approach to\nSection 3283 would run contrary to Congress’s intention to “cast a wide net to ensnare as many\noffenses against children as possible.” 865 F.3d at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96). On\nthis point, it bears emphasizing that the interpretation the defendant advances would lead to absurd\noutcomes, as many federal crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors do not contain, as an\nelement, a requirement that the defendant commit a sex act with a minor. It would run contrary to\nCongress’s intent to interpret Section 3283 in a manner that would exclude many—if not most—\nsexual offenses against children.\n\nThe lone Section 3283 case the defendant cites, United States v. Countentos, 65l F.3d 8o9\n(8th Cir. 2oll), is easily distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered,\namong other issues, whether the crime of possessing child pornography involved sexual abuse\nwithin the meaning of Section 3283. /d. at 8l6-l8. In analyzing that question, the court discussed,\namong a variety of factors, the elements of the crime.

Miller, 483\nU.S. 756, 765 (l987)).\n\nThe defendant has otherwise failed to identify hou she has been deprived of the right to a\nfair trial. A jury will hear testimony about the defendant’s statements during her April and July\n2ol6 depositions, along with other evidence, and determine if her statements were perjurious.\n\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression.

Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. A question is “fundamentally ambiguous” when “it is not a phrase with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual\nunderstanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and\noffered as testimony.” /d. at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). In such a case, the “answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Lighte, 782\nF.2d at 375). For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\nindication that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the exception, not the\nrule.” United States v. Sarwari, 669 F.3d 4ol, 4o7 (4th Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.\nFarmer, l37 F.3d l265, l269 (loth Cir. l998)). A defendant cannot demonstrate fundamental\nambiguity simply by shouing that words used in a question are amenable to multiple meanings,\nor that an answer “might generate a number of different interpretations.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375;\nUnited States v. Strohm, 67l F.3d ll73, ll78 (loth Cir. 2oll) (“Simply plumbing a question for\npost hoc ambiguity will not defeat a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> where the evidence demonstrates the\ndefendant understood the question in context and gave a knouingly false answer.”). “If, in the\n“” The Second Circuit analyzes general principles of perjury similarly under l8 U.S.C. § l623 and\nanother perjury statute, l8 U.S.C. § l62l, see Lighte, 782 F.3d at 372, and it has assumed without\ndeciding that those standards also apply to offenses under l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(2), see United States\nv.

Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). Critically, and as\nnoted with respect to Lighte above, courts generally evaluate whether a challenge to a perjury\ncount on the basis that a question was fundamentally ambiguous after trial and follouing the\ndevelopment of a full factual record. See, e.g., Strohm, 67l at ll75 (appeal follouing <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>);\nSarwari, 669 F.3d at 4o6 (same); Farmer, l37 F.3d at l269 (appeal follouing <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and\npartial Rule 29 dismissal) Markiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8o8 (appeal follouing <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>); cf’ United\nStates v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l3 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (denying a motion to dismiss a perjury\ncount). Indeed, the defendant cites no case in which a court has dismissed a perjury count on the\nbasis of “fundamental ambiguity” before trial.\n\nBecause perjury requires a knouing false statement, the law does not permit <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\nbased on answers that are literally true. See Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. Nor can a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> rest on\nanswers that are literally true but unresponsive, and therefore “arguably misleading by negative\nimplication.” /d.; see Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). But when “the answer\nis false, the fact that it is unresponsive is immaterial.” United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d lo42, lo49\n(2d Cir. l976). Even statements that “could be literally true in isolation” can support a perjury\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> if they are “materially untrue” in “the context in which the statements were made.”\nUnited States v. Schafrick, 87l F.2d 3oo, 3o4 (2d Cir. l989). “[U]nless the questioning is\nfundamentally ambiguous or imprecise, the truthfulness of [the defendant’s] answers is an issue\nfor the jury.” Jd. at 3o4; see United States v. Kaplan, 758 F. App’x 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (same);\ncf. Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374 (finding the evidence insufficient where some answers “were literally\ntrue under any conceivable interpretation of the questions”).\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 239\n\nFinally, even if a defendant makes a knouing false statement, a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> requires\nthat the statement be material. A false statement is material if it has “a natural tendency to\ninfluence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was\naddressed.” United States v. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (quotation\nmarks omited). A statement made in a civil deposition is also material if “a truthful answer might\nreasonably be calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the\nunderlying suit.” United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994)); see United States v.\nBirrell, 47o F.2d ll3, ll5 n.l (2d Cir. l972) (explaining, in the context of a motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis and for appointment of counsel, that “it must be shoun that a truthful answer would\nhave been of sufficient probative importance to the inquiry so that, as a minimum, further fruitful\ninvestigation would have occurred.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). “The\ntestimony need not have actually influenced, misled, or impeded the proceeding.” United States\nv. Chan Lo, No. l4 Cr. 49l (VSB), 2ol6 WL 9o76234, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2ol6), aff'd 679 F.\nApp’x 79 (2d Cir. 2ol7); see Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d at 4l2. Since materiality is an element of the\noffense, it is a question for the jury “except in the most extraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o\nF. Supp. 2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects to prove at trial that the defendant’s deposition statements were\nknouingly false. The defendant’s strained efforts to inject ambiguity into the questioning and to\njustify her answers as truthful are in significant part, arguments that are properly put to the jury\nand not a basis to dismiss the counts pretrial and without the benefit of a complete record. See\nUnited States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 237 F. App’x 625, 627-28 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“Generally, the meaning and truthfulness of a defendant’s statement is a question of fact for the\n\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 239\njury.”). At this stage, the defendant must identify defects so fundamental that the charged\nstatements cannot, as a mater of law, support a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. She has failed to do so, and\nher motion should be denied.\n\nl. April 2ol6 Deposition\n\nAt the April 2ol6 deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant about hou Giuffre\ncame to Epstein’s home (Ex. lo at l4:9-l7:4), whether hired massage therapists engaged in sexual\nactivity with Epstein (id. at 5l:l3-55:l6), and the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s Florida\ncriminal case (id. at l7l:25-l73:l2, l83:25-l86:2l), among other topics. The transcript makes\nclear that when the defendant did not understand a question, she said so. (See, e.g., id. at 9:4-9\n(“[C]an you please clarify the question. I don’t understand what you mean by female, I don’t\nunderstand what you mean by recruit.”), 39:23-24 (“I don’t understand what your question is\nasking.”’), 94:l8-95:4 (“You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap\nme, I will not be trapped.’’), l38:6 (“Define relationship.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a\ngood question, sorry.’’).\n\nCount Five charges the defendant with perjury arising from two colloquies at this\ndeposition. First, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions about whether the\ndefendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired\n“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-l8). Guiuffre’s counsel asked\nwhether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the\ndefendant testified that they were all adults except for Giuffre, who she acknouledged at least\nclaimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:l8-25l:l2). Giuffre’s counsel then asked questions\nabout whether Epstein had a “sexual preference for underage minors,” which drew objections from\n\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003096.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 239\n\nThe defendant is, of course, free to testify on her oun behalf to her professed confusion or\notherwise argue to the jury that the questions were ambiguous or the answers truthful. The issue\nbefore the Court is whether the questions were so fundamentally ambiguous that a jury, after\nhearing the trial evidence, could not conclude that the “response given was false as the defendant\nunderstood the question.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). The\ndefendant has failed to establish such a fundamental defect.”\n\n3. Materiality\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that none of these answers was material to the defamation\naction. Asa threshold issue, houever, materiality is also not appropriate for resolution on a motion\nto dismiss the indictment. As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for discovery in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“It is customary, and ordinarily not\nimproper, to include more than one allegedly false statement in a single count. ... Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\nsufficient to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 239\nof the indictment and draw inferences as to proof to be adduced at trial, for ‘the sufficiency of the\nevidence is not appropriately addressed on a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment.’” /d.\n(quoting United States v.

Walsh, l94 F.3d. 37, 45 (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nAlthough courts have identified certain crimes for which an indictment may require greater\nspecificity beyond tracking the language of the statute, such cases are “very rare.” Stringer, 73o\nF.3d at l25. For example, the Second Circuit has clarified that within this “less-common category”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 239\nregarding hou the defendant is alleged to have commited the crimes charged in Counts One\nthrough Four. See Indictment 9 l-ll. Indeed, “by providing Defendant with a narrative of the\nmanner in which Defendant is alleged to have commited the charged offenses, the Indictment\nprovides Defendant with more detail than is strictly necessary” under the governing law. United\nStates v. Kozel, No. l9 Cr. 46o (KMW), 2o2o WL 475l498, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2o2o).\n\nAlthough the defendant complains that some of the terms used in the speaking portions of\nthe Indictment are somehou vague, she cites no authority to suggest that her difficulty\ncomprehending basic language in portions of a charging instrument that do not speak to the\nelements of the offense requires dismissal.°> Counts One and Three, charging the defendant with\nviolations of l8 U.S.C § 37l, “clearly contain[] the elements of the offense charged, fairly inform[]\n[her] of the charge[s] against [her], and enable[] [her] to plead an acquital or <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> in bar of\nfuture prosecution for the same offense.” United States v. Bunn, l54 F. App’x 227, 229 (2d Cir.\n2oo5). Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific reference to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’). In any event, whether grooming alone\nconstitutes a crime is immaterial to the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide whether\nthe evidence at trial, as a whole, establishes the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 43 (2d Cir. 2olo) (declining to vacate\na <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on a statute with only prospective application when “the Government presented post-\nenactment evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements” in addition to evidence of relevant pre-\nenactment conduct). Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33. As such, this motion\ndoes not offer a basis for a bill of particulars.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 239\n\na conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, to entice minors to travel with the intent to commit\nan illegal sex act, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). See Indictment 4 l5-l7. In other words,\nCount One and Count Three charge the defendant with agreeing to commit two separate and\ndistinct federal crimes.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant does have a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury\nconvicts on more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple\npunishments for the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only\none of the multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> has already\nbeen entered on multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but\none count. /d.\n\nThe Second Circuit has clarified that District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss\na charge on multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing. See id. (vacating district court’s\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 239\ndismissal of count as multiplicitous prior to trial, as such a determination before trial is “at best\npremature”). Among other reasons, courts look to “the record as a whole in determining whether\nan indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until trial is\ncomplete. United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Additionally, because\ndouble jeopardy is meant to protect a defendant from successive punishments for the same offense,\na multiplicitous count does not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See\nJosephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“Where there has been no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> or acquital, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long\nas no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).\n\nFollouing the Second Circuit’s directive, courts in this Circuit regularly defer ruling on a\nmultiplicity motion until after the conclusion of trial. See, e.g., United States v. Halkbank, No. l5\nCr. 867 (RMB), 2o2o WL 58495l2, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l, 2o2o) (denying pretrial motion to\ndismiss multiplicitous count and noting that “‘[c]Jourts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-\ntrial motions to dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.’” (quoting United States v.\nMedina, No. l3 Cr. 272 (PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45l, 464 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“[M]ultiplicity is properly\naddressed by the trial court at the sentencing stage.”); United States v.

Rivera, No. o9 Cr. 6l9 (SJF), 2oll WL l429l25, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2oll)\n(“Since it is possible that the jury will convict defendants on only one (l) of the respective counts\nthat they allege are multiplicitous, and acquit defendants on all of the counts with which they allege\nthat count is multiplicitous, the issue of whether the counts are multiplicitous in violation of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause is premature at the pretrial stage.”’).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One or Three of the Indictment as multiplicitous\nis, at best, premature. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit, this Court should defer\nruling on this motion until after the completion of trial. The additional time will ensure that the\nfull factual record is developed before the Court conducts the multiplicity analysis, and the motion\nmay become moot depending on the jury’s verdict.\n\nFirst, the Court cannot conduct the multiplicity analysis before hearing all of the evidence\nregarding the charges contained in the Indictment. Prior to trial, the record will not be fully\ndeveloped, and the Court cannot conduct the necessary analysis to determine whether the counts\nare in fact multiplicitous. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit and the consistent\npractice in this District, the Court should defer conducting any multiplicity analysis until after\nhearing all of the evidence at trial. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355.\n\nSecond, the motion may become moot because it is possible that the jury could conclude\nthat the defendant is guilty of one of the charged conspiracies but not guilty of the other. That is\nbecause each charged conspiracy alleges that the defendant agreed to violate a different criminal\nstatute. Count One alleges that the defendant agreed to transport minors with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts. Count Three alleges that the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l33", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 239\nspecific than the District where the offense was allegedly commited.”). Rather, “[c]ourts have\nbroad latitude in defining the geographic area from which juries will be selected.” United States\nv. Yonkers Contracting Co., Inc., 682 F. Supp. 757, 768 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Consistent with the\nforegoing, the SDNY Jury Plan creates two separate Master Wheels—one for the White Plains\ncourthouse and one for the Manhatan courthouse, each of which draws from certain counties, with\nsome overlapping counties. SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 348\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her.

USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 348\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo333o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. *™\n\nB.

In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding.

OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual\n\nAbuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a Child.\n\nAs demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly\nand consistently that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense\nthat necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, l4o S. Ct.\n779, 782 (2o2o) (“a court should look to the state offense’s elements” rather than case-specific\nfacts); United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (rejecting argument that “offense\nthat .. . involves” provision permited court to look to case-specific facts, even if necessary to\nsave provision from unconstitutional vagueness); Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484\n(2ol2) (interpreting “offenses that involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that\nnecessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct”) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4) (stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to\nlook to the elements and the nature of the offense . . rather than to the particular facts” at issue);\nBridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 2l7 n.l5, 22l (l953) (limiting extended statute of\nlimitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud against the United States” to\n“offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud the United States is an essential\ningredient of the offense charged”). The government’s atempt to limit this clear line of cases is\nunpersuasive.\n\nThe government claims that a “necessarily entails” approach (or, as the government\ndescribes it, a “categorical” approach) is “only used in setings like sentencing and immigration,\nwhere a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” Opp. 39. While one\nwould expect the government to support such a statement with citations to Supreme Court cases\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3668", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 22\noutside the sentencing and immigration context in which the “necessarily entails” approach has\nbeen rejected, it fails to offer any.” Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by\nMs. Maxwell in which courts have interpreted “offense involving” language in a venue statute,\nwhich has nothing to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer to the\nelements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4)\n(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) 4 2 is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue.”) (emphasis in original); United States v. Ayo, 8ol F. Supp.\n2d l323, l33l (S.D. Ala. 2oll) (“The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of\nSection 3237(a) when such transportation, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense\ncharged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a child”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 22\ncommission of the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, rather than to the elements of the offense.” /d. at 39\n(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense\ninvolving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret\n“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar\ninterpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°\n\nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll),\nsquares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a\ncharge of possession of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct\nthat went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted\nsexual abuse. 65l F.3d at 8l7. The government’s atempt to distinguish Coutentos on the\nground that “this case does not involve the possession of child pornography” (Opp. 4l) misses\nthe point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual\nsexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of child\npomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283\nrequires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard\nallegations of conduct beyond those elements.\n\nFinally, the government atempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court\nused the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of\nlimitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the\ngovernment fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-\n\n° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”\n\nlanguage is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-4o (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at\n6o n.ll). Houever, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no\ncase in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any\nevent, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an\nineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of l6\nAs expected, both depositions were hostile. The questions posed to Ms. Maxwell were\npoorly phrased without regard to the rules of evidence. Accordingly, counsel for Ms. Maxwell\nwas required to object many times. As this court knous, civil litigants are limited to three types\nof objections: form, foundation, and privilege. When those objections are posed, the examiner\nhas the opportunity to ask for the basis of the objection. It is not incumbent, indeed it is not\npermited, for the objecting lawyer to expound on the basis for the objection unless asked.\nVirtually all of the questions that form the basis of Counts Five and Six were the subject\nof valid objections.

It is unlikely that any\nof the answers would have been admited at any trial.\nII. The Questions Were Fundamentally, and Fatally, Ambiguous\nIn addition to being poorly phrased, the questions were unquestionably ambiguous.\n“TW |hen a line of questioning is so vague as to be “fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support\n[a] perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367 (2d Cir. l986); see also United\nStates v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). “Precise questioning is imperative as a\npredicate for the offense of perjury.” Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). “A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous when it is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of\nordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a\nquestioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as\ntestimony.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (cleaned up). Here, the questions were “fundamentally\nambiguous,” containing particular undefined terms, “scheme” and “recruit” for example.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagellofl6\n\nThe government complains that Ms. Maxwell has not cited any cases where a perjury\ncount was dismissed pretrial for “fundamental ambiguity.” Resp. l2o. Of course, the government\nmust knou that myriad examples exist. United States v. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236—37\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2), is instructive:\n\nSuccinctly, the prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin the witness doun to\n\nthe specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o. Any number of\n\nstraightforward follou-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For\n\nexample, in addition to the “atempt” question mentioned earlier, the government\n\ncould have cured the ambiguity by supplying the date, time or location of the target\n\nmeeting, focusing Cicalese's atention on the specific events at\n\nissue. See Razzaia, 37o F.Supp. at 578-79. Left naked, the government's imprecise\n\nquestion did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with\n\na sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering\n\nas he did. Jd. at 579. Asking simple follou-up questions could have resolved the\n\nimprecision and fulfilled the government's obligation under Bronston. Whether by\n\nstrategy or inadvertence, the government did not do so.\nThe Court granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. /d. at 232.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Landau, 737 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. l99o), the court\ndismissed a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's\ngrand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions here are fundamentally ambiguous\nand cannot as a mater of law to support a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Landau's motion is therefore\ngranted and the indictment is dismissed.” /d. at 784-85 (emphasis added). The same is true\nhere. In the context of the questions preceding the selectively quoted testimony in Counts Five\nand Six and the transcripts as a whole, the selected questions were fundamentally ambiguous.\n\nIn United States v. Manapat, 928 F.2d lo97 (llth Cir.l99l), the Eleventh Circuit\naffirmed an acquital on the grounds of fundamental ambiguity as a result of the content of the\nform that was the basis of the prosecution. There, the defendant applied for an Airman Medical\nCertificate to the Federal Aviation Administration. The application included a section entitled\n“Medical History” that contained twenty-four questions regarding “conditions.” The first twenty-\n\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of l6\none “conditions” questions were all medical in nature. The twenty-second and twenty-third\nquestions, houever, inquired about convictions (one about “traffic convictions,” the other about\n“other convictions”). Manapat answered in the negative to both question twenty-two and\nquestion twenty-three, and these answers became the basis for his prosecution for “knouingly\nand willfully” making false statements to any department or agency of the United States. In\naffirming the district court's decision to dismiss the indictment, the Eleventh Circuit stated:\n\nAlthough the single statements “Record of traffic convictions,” or “Record of other\nconvictions” may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing\nwhen buried in a list headed “Medical History” and purportedly concerned with\nmedical conditions.... In order to successfully prosecute an indictment for making\na false statement, the government must not remove questions from the context in\nwhich their answers were given in an atempt to prove their clarity.\nId. at llol.\nAlso helpful is United States v. Chujoy, 2o7 F. Supp. 3d 626, 654-55 (W.D. Va.\n2ol6), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Edlind, 887 F.3d l66 (4th Cir. 2ol8), and aff'd, 77o F.\nApp’x 33 (4th Cir. 2ol9), where the court dismissed multiple perjury and false statement claims,\nholding:\nMoreover, it is not perjurious for [the defendant] to give an evasive answer to a\nbroadly-worded question, so long as her response was not false. See United States\nv. Reveron Martinez, 836 F.2d 684, 689 (lst Cir. l988) (“In order to sustain a\nperjury charge, evasions are not enough. The government must shou more than that\nthe interdicted statement was unresponsive or guarded. At a bare minimum, the\nremark must have been literally false.”); United States v. Earp, 8l2 F.2d 9l7, 9l9\n(4th Cir. l987) (“The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness doun to the\nspecific object of the questioner's inquiry.”); United States v.

No\nreasonable juror could conclude otherwise.\nIn United States v. Ruedlinger, 99o F. Supp. l295, l3o3-o4 (D. Kan. l997), the court after\n“carefully review[ing] the allegations” found that the perjury charge must be dismissed. The\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo372o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. The courts holding is equally applicable here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352 (l973), makes clear that an individual cannot be\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo372l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of8\nnames, but given the government’s recent harbinger of a superseding indictment, likely to\natempt to fix some of these problems, Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and money playing whack-\na-mole with this Indictment.\n\nII. This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of8\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pageloofl7\nguilt or should be so incredible that its very implausibility suggests that it was created to conceal\nguilt.” United States vy. Litlefield, 84o F.2d l43, l49 (lst Cir. l988) (internal citations and\nquotations omited). That is not the case here. Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v.

Once again, the government has scrupulously avoided actually obtaining the\nevidence, and Ms. Maxwell seeks to use Rule l7 as it is intended, to examine the boots in\nadvance of trial. The examination will identify the make and provenance of the boots, something\nwhich would be difficult to do during any trial without significant delay.\n\nSimilarly, the photographs listed in Request ll are physical evidence that exists -- copies\nwere produced by BSF in civil litigation, the photographs are admitedly relevant, and admissible\nas evidence.

First, the documents do not meet the definition of “witness\nstatements.” These are submissions to a fund requesting large sums of money and the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl3\nThe Hon.

Ms. Maxwell must nou: search various records (to the extent they\nare available) and track doun numerous witnesses to determine her locations and activities\nduring this expanded period. She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations. These\nare time consuming and difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial of a\ncontinuance under these circumstances would constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy. Guzman's\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the conspiracy count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the conspiracy was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of discretion.

Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976).

Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v.

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4446", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5o of 349\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004448.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5l of 349\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others. USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v.

Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l8 of 349\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.*“4\n\nB.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.

The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool) (“Given that\na guilty plea is a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against a second\nprosecution for the same offense after <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, the Clause prohibits a second prosecution for\nthe same offense follouing a guilty plea.” (citations and internal quotation marks omited)). But\nit generally does not atach to counts that are dismissed simply pursuant to “an agreement between\nthe parties,” involving no “process that put [the defendant] at any risk of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 89; see Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[S]ince appellants were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges dismissed in the Eastern District, the protection they nou seek under the plea agreement\nis necessarily broader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.”); United States v.\nHernandez, No. o9 Cr. 625 (HB), 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l, 2oo9) (explaining,\nunder Dionisio, that where “Judge Hellerstein merely granted the Government’s motion to dismiss\nCount One pursuant to the plea agreement,” jeopardy did not atach to Count One); cf Evans v.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 26\nMichigan, 568 U.S. 3l3, 3l9 (2ol3) (distinguishing between a “merits-related ruling” during trial\nthat “concludes proceedings absolutely” under the Double Jeopardy Clause and “termination of\nthe proceedings . . . on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense” (internal\nquotation marks omited)). In order for jeopardy to atach to counts dismissed pursuant to a plea\nagreement, the dismissal must involve some adjudication of facts that go to the merits. For\ninstance, “a plea agreement in which the court was directly involved in a defendant’s decision to\nplead guilty to two counts, in exchange for an agreement to drop with prejudice a third count, all\non the basis of findings of certain facts which support that agreement, might perhaps constitute a\npretrial fact-finding that implicated jeopardy in its proper sense of risk of exposure.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 84 (footnote omited).\n\nHere, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida. She was never indicted, acquited, convicted, or punished for the\noffenses in Counts Five and Six. See United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 279 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(explaining that “[i]n essence, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects criminal defendants against”\nsecond prosecutions after acquital or <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, or “multiple punishments for the same offense”\n(quotation marks omited)). At no point did the defendant even risk <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\nThat analysis is unaffected by the NPA. Again, neither the defendant nor Epstein was ever\nindicted by a grand jury siting in the Southern District of Florida nor found guilty of any federal\noffense. NPA or no NPA, jeopardy never atached for the offenses in the proposed USAO-SDFL\nindictment, which was of course never filed. See United States v. Herrera, No. o2 Cr. 477 (LAK),\n2oo2 WL 3ll33o29, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Whatever Epstein’s rights and obligations were\nunder the NPA, including his obligation to plead guilty to two state solicitation offenses, the NPA\nis simply an agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. The USAO-SDFL’s agreement to\ndecline to prosecute other offenses is not an adjudication of any facts that goes to the merits of\nthose offenses. Nor could it be: neither Epstein nor the defendant was charged with those offenses,\nand the NPA was never put before a judge who could engage in fact-finding or even so-order the\nagreement. There is no sense in which the defendant risked <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> or was ever in genuine\njeopardy. See Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d at 84.\n\nThis point is only underscored by United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d 6o3 (2d\nCir. l979), on which the defendant relies. In that case, two defendants, Jesus and Rosalinda\nLosada, were prosecuted for a l974 conspiracy to distribute cocaine, resulting in a guilty plea for\nJesus and, “as part of his plea bargaining agreement, the dismissal of charges against” Rosalinda.\nId. at 637. The two were later charged as part of another cocaine conspiracy. Jd. at 6o7. The\ndefendants argued that the new prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause as to both of\nthem, and the plea agreement as to Rosalinda. /d. at 637. The Second Circuit remanded for the\ndistrict court to reconsider its decision in light of its other holdings narrouing the charged\nconspiracy. It added that “[i]f Jesus’s earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of him because of\ndouble jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the charges against\nRosalinda, the instant prosecution of Rosalinda will also be barred.” /d. at 638. That is, if double\njeopardy barred re-prosecution of Jesus, the prosecution of Rosalinda was barred because of the\nplea agreement. Accordingly, when the district court later dismissed the count against Jesus on\ndouble jeopardy grounds, it dismissed the count against Rosalinda “because of the government’s\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo472l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page lo of 32 6\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl As the Court is aware, this is the defendant's fourth\n2 felony <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for narcotics offense, and we agree with the\n3 probation office that a guidelines sentence would be\n\n4 appropriate in this case.\n\nS THE COURT: Thank you very much.\n\n6 Mr. Donaldson, have you reviewed the presentence\n\n7 report?\n\n8 MR.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. Cosby admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—Cosby provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand Cosby’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against Cosby troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l3 of 8o\nCanadian authorities, in turn, referred the complaint to Philadelphia Police.\nPhiladelphia forwarded the complaint to Cheltenham Police. The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\nthe need arise.

In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard.

Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement.

Though this appeal emanates from Cosby’s\ncriminal convictions, we cannot ignore the true breadth of the due process violation. The\ndeprivation includes the fact that D.A. Castors actions handicapped Cosby in the\nderivative civil suit. Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening Cosby’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore Cosby to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no exclusion of deposition testimony can restore Cosby’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed Cosby. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that Cosby was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those prosecutions involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies. Critically, none of them featured the additional harm inflicted in\nthis case. In none of those cases did the effects of the constitutional violation extend to\nmaters beyond the criminal trial, as was the circumstance here. Accordingly, none of\nthose cases support, much less compel, the limited remedy that the CDO proffers.\n\nThe impact of the due process violation here is vast. The remedy must match that\nimpact.

Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible.

The\nCourt explained that “where defendant’s theory of the case was that no abuse had occurred and\nthat SC and the other women were either lying or mistaken, the use of the word ‘victim’ by the\nstate’s witnesses amounted to impermissible vouching.” /d.

Devey, l38 P.3d 9o, 95 (Utah App. Ct.\n2oo6). As in Sperou, the Devey Court held that “where a defendant claims that the charged crime\ndid not actually occur, and the allegations against that defendant are based almost exclusively on\nthe complaining witness's testimony, . . . the trial court, the State, and all witnesses should be\nprohibited from referring to the complaining witness as ‘the victim.’” /d.

Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o7 Filed ll/o3/2l Page3of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Numerous\nbar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct internet research on\npotential jurors.

For example, just weeks after Judge Pauley conducted\na post-<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> evidentiary hearing in Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the\nfollouing in Formal Opinion 2ol2-2:\n\nJust as the internet and social media appear to facilitate juror misconduct, the same\n\ntools have expanded an atorney’s ability to conduct research on potential and siting\n\njurors, and clients nou often expect that atorneys will conduct such research. Indeed,\n\nstandards of competence and diligence may require doing everything reasonably\n\npossible to learn about the jurors who will sit in judgment on a case.\n\nSimilarly, in 2ol4, the American Bar Association recognized the “strong public interest\nin identifying jurors who might be tainted by improper bias or prejudice,” and therefore opined\nthat it was proper for counsel to research “a juror’s or potential juror’s Internet presence, which\nmay include postings by the juror or potential juror in advance of and during a trial... .” See\nStanding Commitee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 466 at l-2, Am.

Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 54\ninvestigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2ol9 indictment against Epstein\nand a 2o2o indictment against the defendant.\n\nThe defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging\ndecisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6382", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 54\nafter 2ol9, including testimony from two of the Minor Victims, any connection between the\nevidentiary background of the USAO-SDFL’s charging decisions or this Office’s 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and the defendant’s guilt or innocence is atenuated.\n\nIt is not the Government’s view of the evidence at any one time that maters—it is the\nview of the jury considering the evidence before it, and past charging decisions have no bearing\non that evidence.

Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 78 of l27 78\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl l8.

That rule permits\nself-authentication based on “a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a federal\nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.” This rule is satisfied in two ways.\n\nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 9o2(l). Each certification bears “a seal\npurporting to be that of... any state .. .; a political subdivision . . . ; or a department, agency, or\nofficer of’ a state. Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(A). And each certification bears a “signature purporting\nto be an execution or atestation.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(B). The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\nnecessary to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject). That certification must be “made under seal\n... by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political\nsubdivision where the record is kept.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B)(il). Each of the certifications\ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth certificate\nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient. See United States v.\nWeiland, 42o F.3d lo62, lo73 (9th Cir. 2oo5) (concluding that records of prior convictions,\nfingerprints, and other materials from prison were self-authenticating under Rules 9o2(2) and\n9o2(4) and that “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), incorporated into Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 27, accords with our analysis.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nof an offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). That section also expressly includes, in conspiracy cases,\n“any person directly harmed by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the . .. conspiracy\nJe? ded.\n\nA person is “directly and proximately harmed” by a commission of an offense when the\noffense is a but-for and proximate cause of their harm. See, e.g., United States v. Goodrich, l2\nF.4th 2l9, 229 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing the identical language in l8 U.S.C. § 3663A). The\noffense is a but-for cause if the defendant’s conduct was “‘a necessary factor in bringing about the\nvictim’s harm.” /d.

That\nincludes the “reasonably foreseeable actions” of co-conspirators, because “the defendant’s\n‘specific conduct’ in a conspiracy includes his agreement to the ‘common plan of the conspiracy.”\nGoodrich, l2 F.4th at 228.\n\nThese definitions of “victims” encompass a broader set of individuals than the set of people\nwho are injured when all elements of an offense are met. In Goodrich, for instance, a securities\nbroker-dealer “pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to manipulate” the share price of a sham company.\nl2 F.4th at 23l. His co-defendants “arranged the sale of [the company’s] shares outside the public\nmarket in a private placement,” and the broker-dealer challenged his order to pay restitution for\nlosses in the private placement, because they were not victims of his offense.

Moreover, a limiting instruction would be insufficient to overcome the jury’s likely\nstrong emotional response to Accuser-3’s testimony, leaving a substantial risk that the jury would\nmisapply this evidence and convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper basis.

The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect.

See also United States v. Thompson, 976 F.2d 666, 67l (llth Cir. l992)\n(cross-examination regarding witnesses’ “mental condition during the time periods about which\nthey were testifying” is appropriate since those “records [a]re highly probative of the witnesses’\ncredibility (citing United States v. Lindstrom, 698 F.2d ll54 (llth Cir. l983); United States v.\nPartin, 493 F.2d 75o (Sth Cir. l974))). Applying Sasso, Dr. Hall’s opinions are relevant and\nadmissible.\n\nThe standard for relevance is “very lou,” United States v. Litvak, 8o8 F.3d l6o, l9o (2d\nCir. 2ol5) (reversing <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based on district court’s erroneous conclusion that defendant’s\nexpert evidence was irrelevant); United States v.

R. Evid. 4ol. “To be relevant, evidence need not be sufficient by itself to prove a fact in\nissue, much less to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d\nlo2, l32 (2d Cir. 2olo). “[U]nless an exception applies, all ‘relevant evidence is admissible.’”\nWhite, 692 F.3d at 246.

Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII. Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o. In ruling on the motions in\nlimine, the Court expressly declined to prohibit Ms. Maxwell from challenging the consistency\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document536 Filed l2/lo/2l Page3oof43 3\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl I got supplemental briefing on to discuss.

Yesterday\nl6 defense counsel told us that they're not in a position to tell\nl7 us that they will not cross on any of those topics. Because\nl8 there are many of them and because they include things like\nl9 criminal convictions that are beyond the scope of 6o9 and other\n2o personal information that might either identify anonymized\n2l witnesses or embarrass witnesses, we would ask to be able to\n22 submit briefing rather than raise those issues on the public\n23 record.\n24 THE COURT: You can, but not until you have further\n25 discussion and narrou disputes, because that's going to happen.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document536- Filed l2/lo/2l Page4of43 4\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl MS.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government writes regarding the two issues remaining follouing today’s charge\nconference.\n\nFirst, the Government opposes the addition of Sand instruction 7-l2 regarding the\nimpeachment of witnesses by felony convictions. That limiting instruction is meant to “tell the\njury why the felony <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> was put before them.” Sand Instr. 7-l2 cmt. It is useful in cases\nin which the prior felony convictions are sufficiently significant that they are an important part of\nthe defense, and an explanation would aid the jury in evaluating the evidence. In such a case, it\naids the jury to knou that the prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> was offered solely for the purpose of evaluating the\nwitness’ credibility. Here, the only witnesses whose prior convictions were elicited are Carolyn\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8428", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page2of3\nand Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—\nand not at all on cross-examination. Including the instruction therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general instruction on credibility, Instruction 44. That instruction already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is unavailable to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v. Myerson, l8 F.3d l53, l58 (2d Cir. l994) (collecting cases);\nsee United States v. Romero, 3o4 F. App’x l4, l8 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (summary order) (affirming the\n“equally unavailable” instruction where a witness invoked the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment); Sand Instr. 6-7 (explaining that the “uncalled witness equally available” instruction\n“includes situations when the witness has indicated that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right\nnot to testify if called”). That is a sensible result: a witness with criminal jeopardy is not\n“available” to the Government in any more than an abstract sense.

That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page4of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring.

For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2.

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page /7 of 37\nthem with respect to only one, and only one, criminal statute - New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55. In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she experienced at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page8 of 37\n\nA. Background Facts\n\nl. Legal Instructions to the Jury\n\nThe possible bases for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the Mann Act counts was an issue that came up\nrepeatedly and litigated extensively in the context of the motions in /imine, the Court’s limiting\ninstructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these occasions, the government repeatedly\nconfirmed that a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the Mann Act counts could only be based on an intent to violate\nNew York law—specifically, New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55—and not any other state’s\npenal laws. Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be convicted on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n* * XK\nTHE COURT: So the Mann Act ... the case that the government is going to prove\nhere is going to incorporate that as the illegal sexual conduct.\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8932", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l4 of 37\nsufficient for the defendant to shou simply that the proof at trial diverged from the allegations in\nthe indictment. To establish a constructive amendment, the defendant must shou that the\nevidence and jury instructions created a substantial likelihood that she was convicted for\n“behavior entirely separate from that identified in the indictment.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nThe fundamental principle of constructive amendment is clear: ““When the trial evidence\nor the jury charge operates to ‘broaden [ | the possible bases for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> from that which\nappeared in the indictment,’ the indictment has been constructively amended.” United States v.\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (quoting United States v. Miller, 47l U.S. l3o, l38\n(l985) (emphasis omited)).\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up). A defendant\nalleging variance must shou “substantial prejudice” to warrant reversal. /d. (cleaned up). “The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nC. The “Core of Criminality” of the Mann Act Counts Was a Scheme to Entice\n\nor Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with an Intent to Violate\nNew York Law.\n\nThere can be no serious dispute that the “core of criminality” of the Mann Act offenses\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment was a scheme by Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they would\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment itself was clear on its\nface. The substantive Mann Act offenses (Counts Two and Four) specifically alleged in the “‘to\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8938", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008939.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l5 of 37\nwit” clauses that the charges were based on Jane’s travel “from Florida to New York, New\nYork” where Ms. Maxwell intended for her to engage in sex acts with Epstein “in violation of\nNew York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. 4 l5,2l. The Mann Act conspiracy counts\n(Counts One and Three) alleged generally that the object of the conspiracies was to entice or\ncause underage girls to travel across state lines with the intent that they “engage in sexual\nactivity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” Ind. J l2, l8. Houever,\neach count specified in the overt acts that the relevant criminal offense was a “violation of New\nYork Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. {fj l3b, l9b. See Atanasio, 87o F.2d at 8l6 (overt acts\ncan narrou the core of criminality of a conspiracy offense); Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o\n(“[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality,\nan indictment that is drawn in specific terms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts[.]”\n(quoting Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-lo)).\n\nEven more important than the language of the Indictment were the government’s oun\nstatements to the Court about the scope of the Mann Act counts. As set forth above, the\ngovernment consistently represented to the Court, in numerous conferences and filings, that a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under the Mann Act counts had to be based on an intent or an agreement to violate\nNew York law, specifically New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. See, e.g., ll/l/2o2l Tr. 68:2-\n4 (“With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the particular criminal sexual activity relates to a\nparticular statute in New York.”); Dkt. 4lo-l at 52 (“The Government’s proposed instructions\nonly permit the jury to convict on a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55.” (emphasis\nadded)); Tr. 2775:3-6 (“[A]t least as to these Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be\ninstructed here that the relevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York\noffense.”).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8939", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l8 of 37\nwas travel “from Florida to New York, New York,” despite the defense’s request to include that\nlanguage. Dkt. 4lo-l at l9; Tr. 2758:23-276o:9.\n\nThe evidence at trial concerning Count Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane\nand evidence that corroborated her testimony. Jane testified primarily about being sexually\nabused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm Beach. Tr. 298:l6-3l5:l9. Jane also testified that\nshe traveled several times with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when she was l4, l5 and l6 and was\nsexually abused in Epstein’s residences in New York and New Mexico. Tr. 3l6:2-324:2o. As\nmost of these trips were to New York, the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips consisted\nof a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced there. Tr.\n3l7:2-32l:5. But Jane did recall one trip to New Mexico when she was “l5 or l6.” Tr. 32l:6-\n32l:l3. Jane testified that she flew to New Mexico with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and stayed at\nEpstein’s ranch. Tr. 32l:l4-322:6. She further testified that, at some point while she was there,\nsomeone came to her room and escorted her to Epstein’s room where she was sexually abused.\nTr. 322:7-323:l9.\n\nBased on this testimony and the text of the Jury Note, there is a substantial likelihood that\nthe jury did not convict Ms. Maxwell based on Jane’s testimony about the New York trips, and\ninstead improperly based their <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in\nNew Mexico. According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken impression that it would\nbe sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had\nintended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and\ncould not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8942", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2o of 37\nNew Mexico trip to see if it supported a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under Count Four, which led to the question\nposed by the Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Ms. Maxwell on the substantive\nenticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York. It was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under Count\nFour. The Court’s refusal to do so alloued the jury to modify the essential elements of the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8944", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2l of 37\ncharged offense and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was convicted of a crime\nother than the one alleged in the Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a conspiracy or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially Prejudiced Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8945", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law. Tr. 2o48:2o-2o49:l. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for\nconstructive amendment because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of marijuana distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\ninstruction in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying instruction in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting instruction would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion. Ms. Maxwell\nmaintains her position that the conspiracy counts should be vacated or dismissed for the reasons stated in her other\npost-trial motions set forth in this memorandum.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8947", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3o of 37\ntrafficking conspiracy was to “recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain” a minor to\nengage in a commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn and others to\ngive sexualized massages to Epstein in exchange for cash, there would be no sex trafficking\ncount.\n\nFor these reasons, Counts One, Three, and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on\nonly one of these counts.\n\nIi. The Court Should Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conviction</span> and Dismiss the S2 Indictment\n\nDue to Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the\nIndictment due to the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution\nagainst Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due process rights. Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293). The Court denied the\nmotion each time on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell failed to shou “actual and substantial\nprejudice” caused by the delay. (Dkt. 2o7 at l6-l8; Dkt. 3l7 at lo). The Court, houever,\ngranted Ms. Maxwell leave to renew the motion after the conclusion of trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8;\nDkt. 3l7 at lo). Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts the same motion and incorporates the arguments\npreviously made to the Court.\n\nIn addition, the record at trial highlighted numerous other examples of hou the delay in\ncharging this case substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s defense. For example, critical\ndocumentary records and witnesses that would have alloued Ms. Maxwell to effectively\nchallenge the government’s proof were no longer available, including the follouing:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8954", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos. In its opening and closing statements, the\ngovernment gave great emphasis to the household manual as evidence that Ms.\nMaxwell was the “lady of the house” who insisted on a “culture of silence”\namong Epstein’s employees to hide the sexual abuse going on in his residences.\nTr. 34, 2846-47. The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe household manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse throughout the relevant time period. The defense believes she\ncould have testified that Ms. Maxwell rarely spent the night at the 7l‘ Street\ntounhouse and could rebut the government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell was\nalways by Epstein’s side.\n\nFor these reasons and the reasons set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous submissions, the\nCourt should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due\nto prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n\nIV. The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a Reasonable\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts. Tr. 2266:4-2274:l4. The Court denied the defendant’s motion. Tr. 2274:l6.\nFollouing the close of the defense case, Ms. Maxwell reasserted her Rule 29 motion for the\nreasons initially stated. Tr. 2736:8-9. Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts that same motion and\nincorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court, in the\nalternative, (l) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on the Mann Act counts (Counts One through\nFour) and grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a constructive\namendment and/or variance from the allegations in the Indictment, (2) enter judgment on only\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8959", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 36 of 37\none of the three multiplicitous conspiracy counts, (3) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on all\ncounts and dismiss the S2 Indictment for pre-indictment delay, and (4) enter a judgment of\nacquital as to all counts under Rule 29 because the government failed to prove each element of\nthe charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nDated: February ll, 2o22\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Christian R.

Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l52\n(2d Cir. l989),\n\nArgument\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test. See\nUnited States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l72 (D. Mass. 2oll) (“[A] mater is\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5ofl2\nto profit by writing books.* This has given rise to the so-called “stealth juror” who deliberately\nlies or evades full disclosure of bias to get on a jury. In the O.J. Simpson trial, for example, five\njurors were dismissed for misstatements during voir dire, including “[o]ne juror [who] failed to\nreveal that she had been a victim of spousal abuse, despite alleging six years earlier that her\nhusband had shoved her and forced her to have sex.’”*\n\nThe trial of a person accused of a heinous or notorious crime places great pressure on jurors\nto convict to achieve personal acclaim for convicting a despised defendant or to avoid scorn for an\nacquital. Here, for example, Juror 5o’s social media posts expressed appreciation for the\nstatements of gratitude he received for bravely telling his personal story of abuse and convicting\nMs. Maxwell. With so many advocacy groups demanding that victim witnesses be “believed,”\njurors may fear condemnation, or worse, if they acquit. Follouing the acquital of the officers who\nbeat Rodney King, for example, riots took place in Los Angeles and jurors received death threats.°\n\nTo counter the heightened concern with juror bias in high-profile, sensational trials,\nNACDL believes that courts must vigorously protect the integrity of this process on the front end,\nthrough questionnaires and extensive voir dire, and on the back end by refusing to allou a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> where a juror, by his false answers to core questions relating to his ability to be fair,\nhas impaired the Court’s ability to exclude biased jurors from the panel.\n> See, e.g., Believing In The Truth (2ol2) (book by juror in trial of polo mogul John Goodman);\nHung Jury: The Diary Of A Menendez Juror (2ol8); We, The Jury: Deciding The Scot Peterson\nCase (2oo7) (book writen by seven of Scot Peterson’s jurors); Madame Foreman: A Rush To\nJudgment (l996) (book by three O.J. Simpson jurors, with interviews with five additional jurors);\nThe Private Diary Of An O.J. Juror: Behind The Scenes Of The Trial Of The Century (l995).

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the\ncharacter of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009175.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihfexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad de WAd A2predatdr Apay Man fontite\nISEMENT —_—_—Privacy Policy | Feedback Wednesday, Jan 26th 2o22 lPM 3o°F 4PM 29°F —_—5-Day Forecast\nDaily Mail\ncom\nHome | U.K. Sports | U.S. Shoubiz | Australia | Femail | Health | Science | Money | Video | Travel | Shop | DailyMailTV\nADVERTISEMENT\ni | e e. es s T\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:\ne e I ! e\nMaxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex\ntrafficker and reveals his oun abuse ordeal\n* Scoty David , a juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the l2 men and women who convicted Maxwell\non five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week\n¢ Scoty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all\nI've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is belied by the lawyers’ actions.

The jury, it seems, concluded that David did not knou that a lack\nof economic substance made the Jenkins shelters illegal. If that is correct, then David's\nconvictions for mail fraud and tax obstruction reflect his involvement in the three “backdating”\ntransactions.

P. 29(a). “In reviewing a Rule 29 motion, the court ‘must view the evidence in a light that\nis most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable inferences resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.’” United States v.

There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury Convicted The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive amendment or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and convicted\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat conclusion. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law. The jury was not informed of the age of consent in New Mexico or any\nparticular criminal statute in New Mexico. The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52). Such an instruction would have\nprovided the jury some state law to compare to the facts and determine whether it was violated,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9573", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel2of5l\nof these provide any likelihood, much less a substantial likelihood, that the jury convicted the\ndefendant solely because she intended for Jane to be sexually abused in New Mexico.\na. Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico\n\nJane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any\nconstructive amendment argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,\nthe evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act\ncounts. (Tr. 3l49-5o; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.l (stating that the defense does “not contest that\nalleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]\nconspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knouledge that Epstein was\nhaving sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while\ntraveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating\nthe abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent\nwith the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive amendment.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.\nApp’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l); see Gross, 2o2l WL 4685ll, at *28 (noting that if the jury\ndetermined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different conspiracy, the jury\ninstructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other conspiracy”). Indeed, that\nevidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of\nAnnie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of\nenhancing the risk of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an\ninstruction, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to\nviolate New York law.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9574", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of5l\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied\nby a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.\n\nb. The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7of5l\n\nThat fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about where the jury believed the sexual\nactivity occurred. It is not clear whether the flight on which the “intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the defendant suggests, or the return flight.\nIf it is the flight to New Mexico, it would still be probative evidence on Count Two, albeit not\nsufficient for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. If it is a flight from New Mexico, it would also still be probative and\nwould not pose any risk that the jury convicted based on conduct occurring in New Mexico. And\nif the jury thought that the defendant intended Jane to engage in sexual activity at the conclusion\nof a return flight from New Mexico to New York, it could well have been sufficient for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\non Count Two.\n\nThe issue is further confused by the uncertainty about the question posed by the jury. The\ndefendant understands the question to be about whether sexual activity in New Mexico is sufficient\nto find the defendant guilty. First, the jury’s question does not ask whether certain facts are\nsufficient for guilt; it asks whether the defendant “‘can be found guilty” ifa certain fact is true. The\ndefendant “can” be found guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico, as\ndescribed above. That is a perfectly sensible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was repeatedly\nraised by defense counsel to the Court at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 3l49 (Court stating: “This is the same\ndiscussion we’ve had a couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in\nNew Mexico under the age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage\nin sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this is the same basic discussion that we’ve\nhad. So... I think the proposal made by the defense is wrong.”). And second, the question\nspecifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury note may have been a question about\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9579", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8of5l\nthe scope of accomplice liability, and specifically, whether the defendant is culpable for all conduct\nrelated to a trip even if her role was limited to arranging the return flight. Indeed, the defendant’s\ncurrent understanding of the note’s question was not her initial view, which triggered the defense\nto repeatedly request an instruction about the “purpose of the travel.” (Tr. 3l38; see Tr. 3l3l\n(requesting that the Court direct the jury’s atention to the requirement that illegal activity was a\n“significant and motivating purpose” of the travel)).\n\nIt is therefore too difficult to parse the note into a particular set of facts and a question\nabout those facts. The defendant’s contrary understanding is brimming with speculation. The\ndefendant presumes that the jury note indicates that the jurors “decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped arrange, any of Jane’s trips to\nNew York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her trip to\nNew Mexico,” so “the jury began evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip\nto see if it supported a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under Count Four, which led to the question posed by the jury\nnote.” (Def. Mot. at l4-l5). Nothing in the note explains why the jury was asking the question it\ndid. Indeed, it would be odd for the jury to reject all of Jane’s testimony about travel to New York\nand the ensuing sexual abuse in New York for lack of corroboration, and then conclude that the\ndefendant arranged an unidentified commercial return flight for which there is no specific evidence\nin the record, including no specific corroboration of the defendant’s role in arranging that flight.\n(See Tr. 3l33 (defense argument that there is “no evidence” the defendant arranged a return flight\nfrom New Mexico)). And there is no reason the jury would have rejected Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New York due to lack of corroboration, even though a flight record shous she was\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo958o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 22 of 5l\ndid not modify any essential element of the offense or permit <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based on an entirely\ndifferent theory. Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive amendment but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 26 of5l\nher motion, that these counts are “virtually identical.” (Def. Mot. at 22). But charges that cover\ndifferent schemes under different statutes are not “virtually identical.” The Court should reject\nthis argument.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant has a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United States\nv. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury convicts\non more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” /d. Similarly, where the judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> has already been entered\non multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but one\nmultiplicitous count. Id.\n\n“For purposes of a multiplicity analysis, the determinative issue is not whether the same\nconduct underlies separate counts, but whether the offense charged in one count is the same as the\n25\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 34of5l\n\nIt makes no difference, as the defendant argues, that both crimes involved grooming minors\nfor sexual abuse. (Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws. That is\nwhat the S2 Indictment charged, and that is what the Government proved at trial: different\nconspiracy crimes. The Court should deny the motion and enter judgment on Counts Three and\nFive.\n\nIll. The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her <span class=\"highlight\">Conviction</span> and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper Pre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo). Her arguments fare no beter post-trial.\n\nThe defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment.

Long, 697 F. Supp. 65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988). The defendant has not made such a\nshouing. Her abstract assertions simply do not rise to that level, and the law is clear that “proof\nof prejudice must be definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6; see also Long, 697\nF. Supp. at 657 (finding that “perceived prejudice is speculative” where there was “no way of\nknouing what [the unavailable witness’s] testimony would have been”); United States v. Valona,\n834 F.2d l334, l339 (7th Cir. l987) (noting that prejudice analysis must consider whether the\nmissing witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” whether the jury would have found\nhim a “credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when compared to other trial evidence\n“would affect the trial outcome”); Spears, l59 F.3d at lo85. “Courts have generally found that\nvague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do not justify\ndismissing an indictment for delay.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7); see also United States v. Scala, 388 F.\nSupp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5) (“Counsel’s unsworn assertions as to vague generalities”\nthat witnesses, “if alive, would give testimony helpful to [the defendant] do not shou that [the\ndefendant’s] ability to present a defense has been substantially and actually prejudiced.”). Here,\n“there is no evidence before the Court as to what [the deceased witnesses] would have testified,\nmuch less specific evidence of hou losing that testimony has caused [the defendant] actual\nprejudice.” /d. at 4oo. The defense’s unsworn assertions about what “the defense believes” these\nwitnesses “could have established” or “could have testified” to do not justify dismissing the\nIndictment or vacating the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.

The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motion for Judgment of Acquital Under\nRule 29\n\nIn a brief paragraph at the end of her motion, the defendant “reasserts th[e] same motion”\nunder Rule 29 she made follouing the close of the Government’s case and the close of her case\nand “incorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.” (Def. Mot. at 3o). The Court\nshould reject those arguments as it has before.\n\nThe defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\nCounts One and Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the record\nlacked sufficient evidence that the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this\nconspiracy persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-7o (“There is not testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\nMaxwell encouraged [Jane] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquited the defendant on Count\nTwo, the substantive enticement count. As to Count One, the jury could have readily concluded\nthat the defendant conspired with Epstein to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to\nEpstein’s various properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,\nJane testified that she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 32o). And the\nrecord is replete with testimony regarding the manner in which the defendant worked with Epstein\nto groom minor victims and entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties. (See, e.g., Tr. 3oo (Jane\nseeing the defendant topless), 348 (making Jane feel special, in part by taking her on “field trips”),\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 66\n2d at 468 (quoting Dyer v.

Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test.

In Justice Blackmun’s words,\nwhich were joined by Justices Stevens and O’Connor and expressed a view shared by Justice\nBrennan and Justice Marshall, “regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, it\nremains within a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to order a post-\n\n> The government implies something deceitful by Ms. Maxwell’s reliance on Justice\nBlackmun’s and Justice Brennan’s concurrences, noting that six justices joined Justice\nRehnquist’s McDonough majority opinion.

This Court should reject the government’s atempt to manufacture a\n“Shou Hearing”.\n\nTo read the government’s brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful\nhearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 5o: were\nyour false answers to Questions 25 and 48 merely inadvertent; and, even though you were a\nvictim of child sexual abuse, isn’t it true that you were a fair and impartial juror (even though\nyou have admited using your oun experience to convince lo other jurors to convict Ms.\nMaxwell)? The government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\nl. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.\n\nFirst, the parties should be permited to question Juror No. 5o, as occurred recently in this\njudicial district.? United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"We therefore\ncaution district courts that, if any significant doubt as to a juror’s impartiality remains in the\nwake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should\nbe held. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind\na juror’s false replies.\") (citations omited).\n\n8“ A] shou trial can be defined by the presence of two elements. The first element is\nincreased probability of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> resulting from the planning and control of the\ntrial. The second element is a focus on the audience outside of the courtroom rather than on the\naccused—the extent to which the trial is designed or managed for the benefit of external\nobservers rather than for securing justice for the defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Shou\nTrials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is belied by the lawyers’ actions.

That fact, coupled with the prominence of the Jenkins\nfirm and the knouledge that other law and accounting firms were marketing similar products,\ngave David comfort that the tax shelters were lawful. Like many others, he believed that\nDaugerdas and his partners had found a “loophole” that could be exploited until it was closed.\nFrom l998 to 2ool, tax shelter trades became a part of David’s business.\n\nAs we see it, the jury accepted the proposition that David was not a culpable\nparticipant in the overall Jenkins tax shelter scheme. His acquital on the tax conspiracy count\nand the substantive tax evasion counts (and the complete acquital of his co-defendant Craig\nBrubaker) confirm the point. The jury, it seems, concluded that David did not knou that a lack\nof economic substance made the Jenkins shelters illegal.

Pauley, III\n\nMarch 7, 2ol3\n\nPage l3\n\nAs noted above, we believe that the jury convicted David for his involvement in\nthree backdating transactions from which he barely profited. He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. And the stigma of the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v.

Parse in particular was charged with\na conspiracy to the defraud the IRS, to commit tax evasion, and to commit mail and wire fraud\n(Count One), as well as three counts of tax evasion relating to the tax shelter transactions of three\nseparate tax shelter clients (Counts Seventeen, Eighteen, and Nineteen). Parse was also charged in\nCounts Twenty and Twenty-Five with engaging in a corrupt endeavor to obstruct and impede the IRS\nand mail fraud, respectively, essentially through the same conduct underlying the Count One\nconspiracy charge.\n\nOn February 28, 2oll, trial commenced against Parse and his co-defendants. On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels. As calculated by Probation, the final offense level is 4o, calling for a Sentencing Guidelines\nsentence at the statutory maximum, 23 years’ imprisonment. PSR 4 lo3. The breakdoun of Parse’s\nGuidelines calculation is as follous:\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page /7 of 24\nindicating that it is confused, “[i]t is the responsibility of the trial judge to provide the jury with\nsufficient instruction to enable it to assess the evidence within the proper legal framework and to\nreach a rational verdict”). The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive amendment and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it concluded that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 24\n4685ll, at *23 (“[T]he Second Circuit has emphasized the pouer of limiting instructions to\nprevent constructive amendment[.]” (emphasis in original)). By declining to provide a\nsupplemental instruction, the Court created “a substantial likelihood” that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of crimes “distinctly different” from the ones alleged. Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\n*2l; see also Millstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to\nbroaden the possible bases for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> from that which appeared in the indictment, the\nindictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government argues that any confusion the jury may have had on the issue of intent\nwas ameliorated by the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the existing instruction on the second\nelement of Count Four. (Opp. at l9). According to that instruction, the government had to prove\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law” and further specified that the\nrelevant criminal offense was a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. (Instr. No.\n2l). The government contends that the jury could not have misunderstood the instruction\nbecause it did not mention New Mexico at all and only mentioned an intent to engage in sexual\nactivity that violated New York law. (Opp. at l9-2o).\n\nThe government’s confidence, houever, is belied by the Jury Note, which indicates that\nthe jury thought it could potentially convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four if it found that she\nintended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. And it is not hard to see where\nthis confusion came from. Although the jury instructions state that the jury needed to find that\nMs. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” nouhere in the jury instructions does it\nstate that a violation of New York law, or specifically a violation of Section l3o.55, must occur\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel4 of 24\nCourt’s error was compounded by its earlier refusal to instruct the jury that Jane’s sexual abuse\nin New Mexico could not be considered “illegal sexual activity” as charged in the Indictment\nbecause it was not a violation of New York law, as it had instructed with regard to Kate and\nAnnie Farmer’s testimony. (Tr. 2775-77). As a result, the jury instructions were insufficient to\nproperly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of a crime other than the one alleged in the Indictment. Moreover, because the Mann\nAct conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) required an identical finding of intent, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury improperly convicted Ms. Maxwell on those counts based on\nthe same conduct. Accordingly, the Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts\nOne, Three, and Four, and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nIl. All Three Conspiracy Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based on a\n\nSingle Underlying Criminal Scheme.\n\nThe government concedes in its Opposition that the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three are so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should only\nenter judgment as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24) (“[T]he Government agrees that the\nCourt should enter judgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the\nsimilarities between those counts.”). The government maintains, houever, that the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five is not multiplicitous and that the Court should enter\njudgment on Counts Three and Five because they “arose from different criminal schemes,\ninvolving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and a different modus\noperandi.” (Opp. at 24).\n\nThe government’s atempt to separate and distinguish the conspiracies charged in Counts\nThree and Five is directly contrary to its theory of prosecution and the proof at trial, and flies in\nthe face of the arguments the government made to the jury. The government never framed these\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel5 of 24\ncounts in the Indictment or in its arguments to the jury as two separate criminal agreements\nbetween Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to commit two separate crimes. To the contrary, the\ngovernment’s theory throughout the case was that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal\nconspiracy with Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the\nsame overarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation\nthroughout the entire time period alleged in the Indictment.\n\nThe government’s arguments to the jury were consistent with the proof at trial, which\nestablished, at most, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, not\nmultiple independent conspiracies. See United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279, 3o7\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“A single agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy,” but\n“multiple agreements to commit separate crimes constitute multiple conspiracies” (quoting\nUnited States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989)). Indeed, the government repeatedly\nemphasized to the jury the similarities of what occurred to the four accusers and the “common\nplaybook” that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used with each of them. (Tr. 2848) (“[Maxwell] ran\nthe same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt’).\n\nThe government’s current position is a l8o-degree about-face and is nothing more than\nan after-the-fact atempt to preserve as many counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> as possible and avoid the\nconsequences of its oun charging theory.

(Tr. 3o2).\nAnd both Jane and Annie Farmer testified about massages. (Tr. 3o8-ll; 2o83-86).\n\nThe government’s atempt to characterize Count Three as an “earlier scheme” and Count\nFive as a “later pyramid scheme” with different objects and methods is unavailing. (Opp. at 32).\nThe government’s theory, as presented to the jury, was that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell engaged in\na single conspiracy with a common method of operation and objective: to recruit and “groom”\nunderage girls to sexually abuse them. That theory was entirely consistent with the evidence at\ntrial. For these reasons, Counts Three and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page2 of 45\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo368", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury” —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25.

The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” Fed.

Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear ‘merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary circumstances, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.”\nUnited States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n* The Defendant also contends that her <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here. In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were\nconstructively amended are the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 37 of 45\nrequest a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that\nshe was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)). The Defendant “must shou both\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 44 of 45\nwould have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence\npresented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the\nDefendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to\ncreate the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 45 of 45\ncaptured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced\nby any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant’s\nmotion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with\nCount Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three.\nCount Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant’s participation in the same\ndecade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein,\nto groom and sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will enter judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Counts Three, Four, and Six.\nThe Defendant’s sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set\na schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656.\nThis resolves Dkt.

See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 Guidelines apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually incorrect. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\nGuidelines in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which Guidelines book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that determination, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 Guidelines; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 Guidelines in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n? The five-point difference in the total offense level is driven by the base offense level. Under the 2oo3 Guidelines,\nthe applicable base offense level is l9. See USSG § 2Gl.l(a)(l) (2oo3). Under the 2oo4 Guidelines, the applicable\nbase offense level is 24. See USSG § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4).

The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\nrecollection of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>’ for ex post facto purposes and ... Application Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\nreasonable to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 Guidelines. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 Guidelines to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\nnevertheless vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 Guidelines apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier Guidelines were in effect. Such a\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l4 of 29\n(Posner, J.) (“A judge might reasonably conclude that a sentence based almost entirely on\nevidence that satisfied only the normal civil standard of proof would be unlikely to promote\nrespect for the law or provide just punishment for the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”). Accordingly, the\nCourt should exercise its discretion to vary from the 2oo4 Guidelines and sentence Ms. Maxwell\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines. See id. (the § 3553(a) sentencing factors “are broad enough and\nloose enough to allou the judge to dip belou the guidelines range if he is justifiably reluctant to\nimpose a sentence most of which rests entirely on a finding of fact supported by a mere\npreponderance of the evidence”).\n\nIl. The Five-Point Adjustment Under USSG § 4Bl.5 Does Not Apply.\n\nProbation and the government seek to substantially increase Ms. Maxwell’s Guidelines\nrange by adding a five-point adjustment under USSG § 4Bl.5 applicable to a “Repeat and\nDangerous Sex Offender Against Minors.” That one adjustment increases Ms. Maxwell’s\nadvisory sentencing range from l68-2lo months to 292-365 months — a roughly 75% increase.\nBut § 4Bl.5 was intended to apply only to habitual sexual offenders who present a high risk of\nrecidivism and pose “a continuing danger to the public.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background. The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the adjustment ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the application of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 29\n552 U.S. 85, lo8-o9 (2oo7) (“[A] district court may vary from the Guidelines range based solely\non a policy disagreement with the Guidelines, even where that disagreement applies to a wide\nclass of offenders or offenses.”). Section 4Bl.5 should therefore not apply.\nTil. Ms. Maxwell Does Not Qualify for an Aggravating Role Adjustment Under USSG §\n3BLL.\n\nA. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Supervise Another Criminal Participant.\n\nUnder the plain language of USSG § 3Bl.l and its commentary, Ms. Maxwell does not\nqualify for an aggravating role enhancement. The Guidelines are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\nadjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\nconvicted.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\nGuidelines analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the application of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page3of77\nthreats continue while she is incarcerated.' It would be a travesty of justice for her to face a\nsentence that would have been appropriate for Epstein.\n\nIn its Final Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”), Probation recommended a sentence\nof 24o months’ imprisonment, a slight dounward variance from the sentence recommended by\nthe advisory Guidelines.

The\nplea and sentence were negotiated without notice to Epstein’s victims.

Her relationship with Wait was on track for marriage and gave her what she had always\nhoped for and wanted most — the opportunity for a loving, stable family life and the chance to\nbecome stepmother to Wait’s children. But her hopes were destroyed, as was so much of her life,\nby her previous association with Epstein. A Miami lawyer named Scot W.

In the\nspring of 2oo9, RRA recruited Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., who immediately joined the firm. By the end of\nOctober 2oo9, Rothstein became a fugitive, and later returned to face arrest, to plead guilty to RICO charges\nin SDFL, and to receive a 5o-year sentence. See o9 Cr. 6o33l(JIC). Rothstein had targeted Wait, the deep-\npocket co-founder of Gateway, Inc., because of his ongoing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, who had\npreviously been involved with Epstein. Rothstein demanded $lo million to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out\nof civil lawsuits. Wait successfully resisted Rothstein’s blackmail atempt, but Ms. Maxwell was named\nin lawsuits filed by RRA.

United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 35of 77\n\nmore than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follous that proportionality requires the severity\nof confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial.

Nathan\nSiting By Designation\nUnited States District Court\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not request sealing or\nredaction of the leter submited by Robert Y. Lewis, Esq., counsel to Sarah Ransome and\nElizabeth Stein. Houever, Mr. Lewis’s leter raises an issue that we believe the Court must\nresolve prior to the sentencing hearing; namely, who may submit victim impact statements to the\nCourt or address the Court at sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).\n\nUnder the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably\nheard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any\nparole proceeding.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense\nin the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of\n“direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only covers victims of\nthe conduct underlying the offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. See United States v. Daly, No. 3:ll-cr-l2l\n(AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he determination as to whether\nperson has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is made with reference to the\nconduct underlying the charged offense.) (emphasis added).\n\nThe conduct underlying the offenses charged against Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about\n2oo4.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a victim of Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell from approximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in\nthis case ended. She therefore does not qualify as a “crime victim” under the CVRA. We do not\nknou when Ms. Stein alleges that she was a victim, but she would also not qualify as a “crime\nvictim” if the conduct she alleges post-dates 2oo4 or she was not a minor. According to\nuncorroborated press reports Ms. Stein claims to have met Maxwell in l994 when Ms. Stein was\n2l years old and not a minor.\n\nIn his leter to the Court, dated June l4, 2o22. Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome and\nMs. Stein be given an opportunity to speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and\nreferences that Ms. Ransome spoke at the hearing conducted by Judge Berman follouing\nEpstein’s death. But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the\nhearing conducted by Judge Berman. Follouing Epstein’s death, the government moved for a\nnolle prosequi to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding that if a defendant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo53o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel9 of 55\ncurrent version of the Guidelines as representing the most recent views of the agency charged by\nCongress with developing sentencing policy.” Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nWhere the Guidelines have increased after the offense conduct has concluded, “the court\nshall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> was\ncommited.” U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l). Furthermore, Application Note 2 provides that “the last\ndate of the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is the controlling date” for determining which manual to apply.\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2. That is true even if the Guidelines were amended during the\ncourse of the offense conduct. The Second Circuit has explained that “[w]here a conspiracy began\nwhile one version of the Guidelines was in effect and ended after another version became effective,\napplication of the later version to the coconspirators does not violate the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” United States v. Meneilly, 28 F. App’x 26, 32 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citations omited).\n\nHere, the offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> spanned from l994 up to and including 2oo4, as set forth\nin the Indictment, and as the proof established at trial. As a result, for Guidelines purposes,\nDecember 3l, 2oo4 is legally the last date of the offense conduct, and the 2oo4 Manual applies.\nIn her objections to the PSR, the defendant claims that the Ex Post Facto clause requires the jury,\nand not the Court, to determine the last date of the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. The defendant further\nclaims that, as a factual mater, the offense conduct ended before November l, 2oo4, the date upon\nwhich the 2oo4 Manual became effective. For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant is wrong\nas a mater of law and as a mater of fact. The Court should apply the 2oo4 Manual.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo554", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2oof55\nl. The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the Guidelines need not be submited to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 56o F.\nApp’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Morel, No. lo Cr. 798 (PAC), 2o2l WL 282llo7,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of\nwhich Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory\npenalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing\ndoes not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 33 oof55\n\nThe defendant’s argument to the contrary—that her particular crime involved undue\ninfluence of minors—does not demonstrate double-counting. The fact that the defendant’s course\nof conduct triggers both the harm targeted by the base offense level and the harm triggered by an\nenhancement shous that the enhancement applies, not that the enhancement is redundant with the\nbase offense level.\n\nD. The Five-Level Enhancement in Section 4Bl.5 Applies\n\nSection 4Bl.5 has two provisions, depending on whether a defendant has a prior sex\noffense <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Where, as here, the defendant does not have a prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, § 4Bl.5(b)\nadds five offense levels and sets a minimum offense level of 22, so long as the defendant satisfies\nthat section’s three requirements: (l) the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> must be a ““covered sex crime,” (b)\nthe defendant is neither a career offender nor a repeat offender, and (c) the defendant “engaged in\na patern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.” Jd. § 4Bl.l(b). “Prohibited sexual\nconduct,” in turn, covers any offense under Chapters ll7, lo9A, or llo, and any state law offense\nthat would be a federal offense under those chapters if commited “within the special maritime and\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 2426 (2oo3); see U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app.\nn.4(A) (incorporating that definition); see also, e.g., United States v. Phillips, 43l F.3d 86, 9o &\nn.6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying these requirements).\n3 The defendant also argues that the enhancement does not apply as to Jane and Annie because,\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines, the undue influence must occur with the object of having the minor\nengage in a commercial sex act. (Def. Mem. 2l). As explained above, the 2oo4 Guidelines manual\napplies, and it contains no such provision. In any event, Jane testified that she received money\nduring the course of her abuse (Tr. 3ol-o2), and Annie testified that she was promised a trip to\nThailand which she ultimately received (Tr. 2o59, 2o9o-92). See U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.l app. n.l\n(incorporating the definition of “commercial sex act” in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l)); l8 U.S.C.\n§ l59l(c)(l) (2ooo) (defining a “commercial sex act” and “any sex act, on account of which\nanything of value is given to or received by any person”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo568", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 34 of55\n\nAll three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\nJurisdiction of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The background commentary\nincorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 36 of55\nquotation marks omited); see United States v. Parkins, 935 F.3d 65, 67 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (citing\nSash). And even when Guidelines commentary is explanatory and binding, it is “akin to an\nagency’s interpretation of its oun legislative rules,” and therefore does not control where it is\n“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 45 (l993) (quoting\nBoules v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 4lo, 4l4 (l945)). Ifthe Guidelines commentary\nwere flatly inconsistent with the plain text of the Guideline itself—because the Guideline squarely\napplies where the commentary says it should not—the Guideline itself would control. See Sash,\n396 F.3d at 522 (“We need not resort to background commentary interpretations when the\nlanguage of the Guidelines is plain.”).\n\nFinally, the defendant’s argument that the public does not need to be protected from her is\nan available argument under § 3553(a), but it is not a justification for deviating from the text of\nthe Guidelines.*\n\nIll. Discussion\nA. The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the\nGuidelines Range of 36o to 66o Months’ Imprisonment\nl. The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands convicted of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been convicted of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6). But\nSection 4Bl.5(a) is structured differently than Section 4Bl.5(b), seting floors for the offense level\nand criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level increase. See U.S.S.G. Amend.\n6l5 (explaining that § 4Bl.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> but § 4Bl.5(b) does not).\nBecause the Guidelines have different structures, where—as here—a defendant is near the top of\nthe Guidelines by virtue of her criminal conduct on her one and only <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, the five-level\nenhancement is more significant than § 4Bl.5’s penalty floors. That result is not absurd, but a\nreflection of the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo57l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page52 of 55\nclaims that multiple abuses, all of which BOP has concluded were unfounded, were somehou not\ncaught on camera. At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the Guidelines range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage\nof the trial. Given the defense’s exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somehou\ndeteriorated the defendant to the point of struggling to assist in her oun defense, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court put on the record at sentencing the Court’s oun observations\nof the defendant’s appearance and demeanor throughout the proceedings in this case.\n\nIV. Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Pagelof68\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nJune 24, 2o22\nSubmission Under Seal\nHonorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nGhislaine Maxwell submits this leter in response to the Court’s order (Dkt. 665). Ms.\nMaxwell objects to characterization of Sarah Ransome, Maria Farmer, Teresa Helm, and Juliete\nBryant (collectively, the \"Individuals\") as \"victims\" of the counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and disputes that\nthe Individuals qualify as statutory victims within the definition of a \"crime victim\" contained in\nthe Crime Victims' Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.A. §377l (\"CVRA\").\n\nThe issue that requires resolution in advance of sentencing is whether the Individuals, or\ntheir representatives, have statutory crime victim status under the CVRA. Under the statute,\ndefinition of “crime victim” takes as a given that there has been a “federal offense” commited.\nSee l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Ms. Maxwell asserts that the Individuals are not statutory crime\nvictims of the federal offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, which require that (l) each was a minor at the time\nto the alleged abuse, (ll) the alleged abuse occurred during the period alleged in the indictment,\nand (i) the Individuals were “directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of\n[the] Federal offense.” /d.(emphasis added).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo592", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 3 of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThe CVRA Applies Only to Federal Crimes\n\nBased on the text, origin and limited legislative history, the CVRA applies to victims of\nfederal crimes only. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e). The federal crimes of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> require the\ninvolvement of minors. The Individuals claiming sexual abuse who were not minors may\nqualify generically as victims of sexual abuse but not as statutory victims of the federal offenses\nof <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" of the Counts of <span class=\"highlight\">Conviction</span>\n\nNeither the Superseding Indictment nor the Court’s jury instructions support a position\nthat anyone who was not a minor is a \"victim\" of the counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. The involvement of a\nminor is an essential element of the federal offense conduct. Maria Farmer claims she was\nabused during the time period of the indictment; houever, she was not a minor. Sarah Ransome\nwas not a minor when she claims she interacted with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell from\napproximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in this case ended.\nTeresa Helm also was not a minor and it is unknoun when she claims to have had contact with\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. It is unknoun whether Juliete Bryant was a minor or when she claims\nto have had contact with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. None of these Individuals testified at trial\nand their credibility remains unexamined. Regarding the charges in this case, they do not qualify\nas victims under the CVRA.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" Within the Meaning of the CVRA\n\nFor the Individuals to invoke the rights enumerated under the CVRA, they must first be\ndetermined to be \"victims\" within the meaning of the statute. The CVRA defines a “crime\nvictim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal\noffense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo594", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page4of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThe concept of “direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only\ncovers victims of the conduct underlying the offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. See United States v. Daly,\nNo. 3:ll-cr-l2l (AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he\ndetermination as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is\nmade with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each\noffense. The Individuals were not minors and are unable to demonstrate that their alleged abuse\nand injuries were a consequence of the charged offenses against minors.\n\nBecause The Individuals Are Not \"Crime Victims\" Under the CVRA, They Should Be\nPrecluded from Being Heard at Sentencing\n\nThe right to be heard at sentencing applies only to persons who are statutory “crime\nvictims” of the offenses of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime\nvictim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), § 377l (e) (defining “crime victim”). While the sentencing court has\ndiscretionary authority to receive information from a wider range of affected individuals\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 366l, only those holding statutory crime victim status have rights of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo595", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 _ Filed o6/25/22 Page6of2l\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sarah and Elizabeth are categorial “victims” who should be alloued to\nspeak at sentencing. Sexual abusers frequently use their actual or perceived pouer to manipulate and\ncoerce victims during their abuse or trafficking. Jill Laurie Goodman & Dorchen A. Leidholdt,\nLawyers Manual on Human Trafficking, NY State Jud. Comm. on Women in the Court l69-76\n(2ol3). The scheme Sarah and Elizabeth both describe in their victim impact statements is the same\nscheme Maxwell is being sentenced for and it involves the same defendant and co-conspirators as the\nconspiratorial scheme proven at trial.\n\nMoreover, these victim statements reflect Sarah’s and Elizabeth’s personal knouledge of\nMaxwell’s character and actions in furtherance of the scheme. Maxwell’s argument that Sarah and\nElizabeth do not qualify as real victims because they were not minors at the time of the trafficking\nand therefore are not victims within the counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is of no moment. The allegations in the\nsecond superseding indictment easily encompasses these non—minor victims. For example, in\nparagraph 4(e) of the second superseding indictment, which is a sub-part of a count for which there\nwas a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, alleges that “through this process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage\nin sexual activity with Epstein.” Likewise, paragraph 9 of the second superseding indictment alleges\nthat “among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, were\nminor victims identified herein as Minor Victim—l, Minor Victim—2, Minor Victim—3 and Minor\nVictim—4.” A fair reading of the indictment is that although it emphasizes minor victims, the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy—as alleged—encompassed non—minor victims like Sarah and Elizabeth.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagelilof2l\nElizabeth respectfully submit that hearing their unique “information concerning the background,\ncharacter, and conduct” of Maxwell will assist the Court in imposing a fair and just sentence.\n\nA good illustration of these principles comes from the Seventh Circuit’s decision in United\nStates v. Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy. See also United States v. Goss, 325 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 936 (E.D. Wis. 2ol8) (affirming the court’s consideration of information at sentencing that was\nnot, strictly speaking, a “victim” impact statement because the “court can consider information from\na variety of sources” when imposing sentence). Maters of social welfare directly impact decisions\nregarding the appropriateness of a criminal sentence. Krebs v. New York State Div. of Parole, No. 9:o8-\nCV-255NAMDEP, 2oo9 WL 2567779, at *2 (N.D.N.Y.

And Epstein’s escape from <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> through apparent suicide in\ncircumstances where federal authorities should have been more vigilant has created a widely spread\nmeme that “Epstein didn’t kill himself”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if Maxwell’s victims are prevented from speaking at her sentencing, it\nwill compound the public perception that the conspiracy’s victims are being silenced and that co—\nconspirators continue to receive favorable treatment. The best way to dispel this public perception is\nfor the Court to broadly permit a// Maxwell’s victims who wish to be heard at sentencing to speak.\n\nJudge Berman of this Court wisely recognized these realities in allouing all of Epstein’s\nvictims to speak at the court hearing where Epstein’s criminal charges were dismissed after his death.\nSee U.S. v. Epstein, Case No. l9-cr-49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. hearing transcript Aug. 27, 2ol9). As Judge\nBerman explained: “Public hearings are exactly what judges do. Hearings promote transparency and\nthey provide the court with insights and information which the court may not otherwise be aware of.\n‘The victims have been included in the proceeding today both because of their relevant experiences\nand because they should always be involved before rather than after the fact.” Aug. 27, 2ol9, Hrng.\nTrans. at 5. See generally Paul G. Cassell & Bradley J. Edwards, Hearing on Dismissing Epstein Charges\nwas not “Drama” but Proper Respect for Victims, N.Y.L.J., Aug. 28, 2ol9.?\n\nOf course, exactly the same point about the need to promote “transparency” can be made in\nthis case—particularly since the Justice Department has yet to announce any other indictments of\n\n* See htps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_didn%27t_ kill himself.\n\n> htps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2ol9/o8/28/hearing-on-dismissing-epstein-\ncharges-was-not-drama-but-proper-respect-for-victims\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page 2 of 23\nmassages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell’s role in facilitating those\nmassages. Based on all of the information nou before the Court, including a substantially more\ndetailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3\n(Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the anticipated\ntestimony may serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\n\nThe Government rightly acknouledged at the November l pretrial conference that Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be found guilty on this witness’s testimony alone for any of the crimes charged\nin the Indictment. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67:l2-25, 68:l3-l9, 69:4-9, 7o:23-7l:2, 72:22-25. As the\nGovernment acknouledged, with respect to the jury’s determination in this case, this witness is\nnot a victim of any of the crimes charged in the Indictment. See id. at 69:4-9; Nov. lo, 2o2l Tr.\nat l64:l9-l65:3.” Houever, evidence of legal conduct can of course be relevant evidence of\nillegality. And conduct that cannot itself form the basis of a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> can serve as direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir.\n2ol2) (affirming admission of defendant pimp’s relationship with and control over women who\nworked as prostitutes as direct evidence of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) charge). Thus some of the\nanticipated testimony described above can serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe alleged conduct as to Witness-3 was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.\n\nPortions of the anticipated testimony may also serve permissible purposes under Rule\n4o4(b), namely proving motive, intent, and knouledge. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(2). The\nwitness is expected to testify about certain statements by Ms. Maxwell. For example, the\n2 At the November l conference, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion to preclude the Government from\nreferring to alleged victims as “victims” and “minor victims.” Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 4. In contrast to the other alleged\nvictim witnesses, it is not (nor could it be) the Government’s litigating position that this witness is a victim of the\ncrimes charged in the Indictment. Given this, the Government may not refer to this witness as a “victim” or a\n“minor victim” in front of the jury. Doing so would constitute prejudicial error for the reasons explained in this\nMemorandum Opinion & Order.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooollo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page4of23\n\nThe probative value of the anticipated testimony must of course be balanced with any\npotential prejudice under Rule 4o3. As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page6of23\nthis evidence as to the sex trafficking counts, the witness is precluded from testifying that [il\n\nThe Court thus draws the line described above for limiting Witness-3’s testimony.\nPermiting the entirety of the proffered testimony carries a risk that the jury may convict Ms.\nMaxwell due to conduct that cannot form the basis of a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for the charged crimes. But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting instruction to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion. The Defense has submited proposed limiting instructions, and\nthe Government agrees that some sort of instruction is appropriate, although it disagrees with the\nbasis for the instruction. Dkt. No. 452 at 5o n.l2; Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). In\naccordance with this ruling, the Court proposes the follouing instruction before this anticipated\nwitness testifies:\n\nYou will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she had\n\nwith the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over the\n\nrelevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she says occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government has charged in the\n\nIndictment. I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before\n\nyou, you may consider it. Houever, you may not convict the Defendant on the basis of\n\nthe testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein. Nor\nmay you consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the Indictment.\nThe Court also proposes the follouing instruction before any testimony by other witnesses\nregarding sexual activity that occurred after the relevant age of consent:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct that\n\nshe says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico].

(See Dkt. No. 477).\n\nThe Government proposes one edit to the instruction in advance of Witness-3’s testimony.\nSpecifically, the Government proposes inserting the word “solely” in the sentence beginning\n“Houever,” as follous:\n\nHouever, you may not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of the testimony\n\nregarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein.\n\nThis edit clarifies a potential tension within the instruction. As the Court has ruled,\nevidence relating to Witness-3 is relevant to the issues, but cannot on its oun support a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nAbsent this clarification, it may appear to the jurors that they “may not convict the Defendant on\nthe basis of [Witness-3]’s testimony,” i.e., the testimony is not offered as relevant evidence the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nirrelevant. If a commercial sex act occurred involving a l7-year-old in New York, that sexual\nactivity is illegal under l8 U.S.C. § l59l because it involves a minor, even though it is above New\nYork’s age of consent. Although the instruction uses the phrase “illegal sexual activity,” an\nelement of the Mann Act, the jury is likely not to grasp that point in a short mid-trial instruction,\ndivorced from a discussion of the elements of the offenses. The jury would therefore also be\nconfused into thinking incorrectly that sexual activity that is “not illegal” under the local law is\nsimilarly lawful under federal law.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that—as to New Mexico in particular—age of consent is\nnot a simple and straightforward question. As the defense noted in their opposition to the\nGovernment’s motions in limine, “New Mexico does not have a specific age of consent.” (Def.\nOpp. at 46, Dkt. No. 483). The age of consent can also depend on the specific sexual act involved,\nwhich may require analysis of New Mexico state law in comparison to the facts elicited at trial.\nCompare id. at 46 & n.43 (noting that the age of consent depends on whether coercion or force are\ninvolved), with State v. Begaye, -- P. 3d --, 2o2l WL 5l73l5o, at * 2 (N.M. Ct. App. 2o2l)\n(affirming <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of defendant who forcibly hugged a sixteen-year-old and, when releasing\nher, “brushed his hand over her chest and squeezed her breast”). It therefore cannot be said that a\nsexual act in New Mexico was “above the age of consent” without determining what sexual act\noccurred and hou New Mexico state law would treat that act.\n\nIn the Government’s view, these issues are best explained to the jury in the concluding jury\ninstructions, where the jury can be fully instructed on the relevant law and then apply that law to\nthe facts it finds have been established at trial. And no limiting instruction is needed because, as\nwill be explained to the jury in the concluding instructions, they can only convict for violations of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l8 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof3\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY loo22\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP +l2l2 957 76oo phone\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nPursuant to the Court’s Order of earlier today, we respectfully submit this leter in\nopposition to the government’s request to modify the Court’s proposed limiting instruction\nconcerning the testimony of Witness-3. The government’s request is yet another example of its\nrepeated atempts to relitigate issues that have been decided against them. The Court’s instruction\nis appropriate and balanced and should not be changed.\n\nWe should be clear from the outset — we are in this position because the government is\ninsisting on calling a witness who has alleged conduct that is not illegal. The Court has ruled, and\nthe government has itself conceded, that Witness-3 “is not a victim of any of the crimes charged in\nthe Indictment.” ll/l9/2o2l Op. and Order at 2. The Court has correctly recognized that having\nWitness-3 describe the details of her sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein would have no probative value\nbecause it cannot establish an element of the charged offenses. See id. at 4 (“There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding the\nsexual activity cannot form the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of the crimes charged.’’); see also\n2o6l438.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

That is the trade-off they must live with if they persist in\ncalling this witness. Moreover, the government’s argument that the defense has somehou put at\nissue all of the details of Witness-3’s sex acts with Epstein simply by questioning the accuracy of\nthe accusers’ memories is nonsense. The dates and specifics of the alleged abuse of other\nwitnesses are entirely separate from the issue of whether the Court’s proposed instruction is\nmisleading as to the testimony of Witness-3. It is not.\n\nThe Court has already carefully considered the limits of Witness-3’s testimony and has\nbalanced the government’s use of this witness to establish intent, motive, etc., and the need to\nprotect Ms. Maxwell from undue prejudice and a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based on an improper premise.

And the\n\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\n\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\n\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8.

And here\nl8 we don't even have that. We just have her performing what a\n\nl9 travel agent would do, which is arranging travel plans. And\n2o that is not enough, under the wording of the statute, to prove\n2l enticement.

And\nl3 here, your Honor, the government's theory of the case and the\nl4 proof that's been elicited through the testimony is that she\nl5 was an active participant in all aspects of the charges. There\nl6 has been testimony by all of the witnesses that she was not\nl7 only participating and facilitating the sexual encounters but\nl8 that she participated. So we have testimony from Jane that she\nl9 was involved, that Ms. Maxwell was involved in the group\n2o sexualized massages. We had testimony from Annie that the\nal topless massage was done by Ms. Maxwell; she rubbed the top\n22 part of her chest during the topless massage.

EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think they've been fairly\n3 clear. They say: If the defendant aided in the transportation\n4 of Jane's return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico. The\n5 only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is\n\n6 the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.\n\n7 And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the\n8 flight to New Mexico.\n\n9 She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think\nlo it was a litle unclear what may have happened in New Mexico\n\nll based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual\n\nl2 conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are\n\nl3 debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico,\nl4 where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\nl5 Okay. So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at\nl6 least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for\nl7 the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. And they\nl8 are confused that the return flight that happens after that,\n\nl9 could that be the basis alone for a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Count Four.\n2o Answer is no, because that return flight is not for the purpose\nal of illegal sexual activity.\n22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, at the very least, the answer to\n23 this can't be no, because a jury could infer intent to engage\n24 in sexual conduct and the return of a flight in aiding and\n25 abeting that.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4699", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 29 3l33\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl to New Mexico, where/if there was an intent for Jane to engage\n2 in sexual activity.

I do find that Virginia Roberts and\nlo Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were\n\nll trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the\nl2 charged period. The Guidelines require that each minor victim\nl3 be considered a separate count of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. 2Gl.l.(d)l.\n\nl4 Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this\n\nl5 provision only because they were not named in the indictment.\nl6 This is an incorrect basis for excluding them from the\n\nl7 calculation. Relying on commentary by the Commission, the\n\nl8 Second Circuit has instructed \"that conduct against victims\n\nl9 other than those charged in the indictment may constitute\n2o relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be\n2l treated for sentencing purposes as though it occurred ina\n22 separate count of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\" I United States V.

BACKGROUND !\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and\ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage\ngirls. Starting in l994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to\nengage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual\ntopics and sexual abuse. Until about 2oo4, this patern of sexual abuse\ncontinued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in\nvarious locations in the United States.\n\nl. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nIn September 2oo7, follouing state and federal investigations\ninto allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered\ninto an NPA with USAO-SDEL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead\nguilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida\n' Unless otherwise noted, the follouing facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial\nand described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678\nF.3d 2o8, 2lo-ll (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\nentered after a jury trial, the | ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the\nlight most favorable to the Government.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool4855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014865.jpg": "CaseQa26-@2oo83o-BAEmdboduhentl78o2l2 o ilah 3. 27o2/ 24 ag Paget BS of 26\napproach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”*? We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o. Second,\nlegislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly.

The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this\ntestimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.

Epstein Maxwell Vicums@usdo.vov\n; RE: Crime Victims’ Rights Act Implications Regarding Unsealing of Grand Jury\nMaterials in Maxwell Proceedings\nCase: USA v Maxwell\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\nDear Judge Engelmayer:\nWe represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstem and Ghislaine Maxwell, including individuals\nwhose names and identifymg mformation appear m the subject materials and one woman who\ntestified at Ghislame Maxwell’s criminal trial. Many of these victims placed immense personal and\nemotional trust in the federal justice system, with the belief that the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of Ms. Maxwell finally\nrepresented a measure of accountability. Most view that <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> as the only justice they ever\nreceived from the criminal justice system.\nIn that vein, we write to address the Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials\nand to respectfully urge the Court to administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the :\nvictims’ rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, the enduring\ninterests protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nI. Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—\nNot in a Vacuum\n‘The CVRA guarantees victims:\n‘ e The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 377l(a)(l));\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l6 of 27\nHonorable Paul A. Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l7 of 27\nHonorable Paul A.

P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstem/Maxwell victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, §\n377 |(a)(8,) and the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with §\n35o9(d) principles.\n\nIll. Requested Relief\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 377l(a)(5), (c)\\(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data pomts that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards\ncannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Prech, and the CVRA, deny disclosure\nwithout prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\n\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\n\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk aud trauma: the\n\npublic platforming of Ms. Maxwell as a purportedly credible commentator despite her sex-trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and perjury charges, her transfer to louer-security custody, a government request to unseal\n\nfiled without conferral, and the looming specter of clemency.\n\nThese survivors have already endured profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during\n\nthe years of Epsteim’s abuse and in the years follouing.

It ended on December 29, 2o2l, with Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on five of the\nsix counts and her acquital on the substantive enticement count.\n\nThe evidence adduced at trial is well-summarized in Judge Nathan’s post-trial decision\ndenying Maxwell’s post-trial motions, including under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29\nfor a judgment of acquital, Dkt. 657; in the Government’s brief in Maxwell’s appeal, see United\nStates v. Maxwell, No. 22-l426 (2d Cir. June 29, 2o23), Dkt. 79; and in the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in that appeal, see United States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nIn brief, the Government’s evidence included the testimony of four women who\ndescribed the sexual abuse they had suffered, as girls, at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell; the\ntestimony of individuals who worked for Epstein and Maxwell; the testimony of law\nenforcement officials; corroborating physical evidence, including photographs of and evidence\nrecovered from searches of Epstein’s residences, and Epstein’s and Maxwell’s black address\nbook; and other corroborating records, such as flight logs of Epstein’s private planes and FedEx\nrecords.\n\nThe trial evidence focused on six girls, including the four testifying victims, who suffered\nabusive sexual contact as a result of Maxwell’s criminal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn,\nVirginia, and Melissa. It established that Maxwell had been instrumental in an approximately\ndecade-long scheme with Epstein to entice, groom, transport, and traffic numerous young\nwomen and underage girls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. Maxwell helped identify\nvulnerable girls for abuse, targeting those who faced difficult family circumstances, including\n3 On April l6, 2o2l, Judge Nathan granted Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury charges.\n\nDkt. 2o7.

Maxwell, she stated, had “directly[,] repeatedly, and over the course of many\nyears participated in a horrific scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some as\nyoung as l4, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.” /d. at 89. As an example, she noted,\nafter Carolyn had confided in Maxwell her personal history of having been raped and molested\nby her grandfather starting at a very young age, Maxwell used that knouledge to continue the\n“cycle of sexual abuse,” inducing Carolyn to give Epstein “sexualized massages” for “years,”\nand by herself touching Carolyn’s breasts when Carolyn was l4 years old. /d. at 9o-9l. Judge\nNathan also noted that Maxwell had repeatedly deflected blame and lied about her offenses,\nincluding in a civil deposition and to Pretrial Services and the Court. Id. at 95.4\n\nE. Appeal\n\nOn February 28, 2o23, Maxwell appealed her <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence. United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 22-l426 (2d Cir. Feb. 28, 2o23), Dkt. 59. The Second Circuit affirmed. It upheld\nJudge Nathan’s (l) holding that a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution in this\nDistrict; (2) holding that the S2 Indictment had been timely filed; (3) denial of Maxwell’s Rule\n33 motion based on juror misconduct; (4) response to a jury note, which Maxwell had argued\nresulted in a constructive amendment of or prejudicial variance from the S2 Indictment; and (5)\nsentence as procedurally reasonable.

And any such motion to dismiss on this basis today\nwould very likely be futile, because Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> at trial renders all but the most serious\nerrors in the grand jury proceedings harmless. See Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489\nU.S. 794, 799-8o2 (l989) (“Only a defect so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no longer\nto be a grand jury, or the indictment no longer to be an indictment, gives rise to the constitutional\nright not to be tried.”); United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 7o-73 (l986).\n\nThe Government instead invokes the “special circumstances” doctrine, on the ground that\nthere is an “abundant public interest” in obtaining additional information about Epstein and\nMaxwell’s crimes, and the DOJ and FBI’s investigation into them. Gov’t Mem. at 4; see also id.\nat l. It states that “[a]tention given to the Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in\nthe wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum announcing the conclusions of the Government’s\nreview into the investigation,” id. at 5, and that release of the Maxwell grand jury materials is\nessential to the goal of “transparency to the American public,” which “is of the utmost\nimportance to this Administration,” Motion to Unseal at l. “Public officials, lawmakers, pundits,\nand ordinary citizens,” it states, “remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein\nmater.” /d. at 3. And the Maxwell grand jury materials, the Government represents, are\n“critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history,” and “[t]he time for the public to\nguess at what they contain should end.” Jd. at 3-4 (quoting Jn re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive,\nlo4 F.

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why historical or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, historical\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015216.jpg": "American Psychological Association commitee work:\nMember, Communications Commitee, l975-76; Member, Magazine Task Force, l975-76;\nMember, Finance Commitee, l976-78; Member, Comm. on Organization of APA, l977-78;\nCommission on Organization, l978-82; Council of Representatives, Div. 3, l982-85;\nExecutive Commitee, Div. 4l, l98l-85; Member, Ethics Commitee, l984; National\nPolicy Studies Oversight Commitee, l986; Psychology Today, Board of Directors, l987-88;\nComm. on Division/APA Relations (CODAPAR), l988-89, Public Information Comm. l989-l992\nTask Force on Recovered Memories of Child Sexual Abuse, l993-96\nAssociation for Psychological Science (Formerly American Psychological Society) Commitee work:\nFund for Advancement of Psychological Science, Board Member, 2oo3- .

In that case,\n\nll the Second Circuit reversed the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for enticement under\nl2 this same statute, 2422, because the jury was instructed that\nl3 they could convict if they found the defendant made the\n\nl4 possibility of a sex act \"more appealing,\" as if that was\n\nl5 enough to entice, if they made it more appealing.\n\nl6 The court held that that was not enough to establish\nl7 persuasion, inducement, enticement under the statute. And here\nl8 we don't even have that. We just have her performing what a\n\nl9 travel agent would do, which is arranging travel plans. And\n2o that is not enough, under the wording of the statute, to prove\n2l enticement. And there is nothing also from any member of the\n22 conspiracy on that same count, your Honor, doing anything to\n23 arrange or induce the travel.\n24 So I would argue, your Honor, that on the record we\n25 have before us, there is insufficient evidence to establish\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 245 of 267 2273\nLCAVMAX8\n\nl inferences in the government's favor, the jury could\n\n2 conclude -—- they could find a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Counts One and Two.\n3 That bar is surmounted very easily by just the testimony of\n\n4 Jane alone, and I have not even discussed other corroborating\n\na testimony that would support that conclusion.\n\n6 THE COURT: All right.

You\n22 have to shou that Ms. Maxwell enticed Jane to travel to New\n23 York with the intent knouing that when she got there, that\n24 statute, that New York statute that's cited in the indictment,\n25 would be violated.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool646l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 5 of 95 2743\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl testimony was that she recruited Carolyn, and she didn't\n\n2 testify, and I don't think -- this is not the theory that the\n\n3 government's been proceeding on on these counts.

It's the practice, as Sand endorses, to rephrase\nlo \"dominant\" as \"significant or motivating purpose\" to avoid\n\nll confusion, because it doesn't have to be the sole dominant\n\nl2 purpose, it just has to be a dominant purpose, and so from\n\nl3 Sand, that creates ambiguity that it has to be a sufficient --\nl4 such a big purpose that it's the dominant purpose, which is not\nl5 what is required by the statute. This instruction suggests\n\nl6 there's an additional requirement, which is that it be some\n\nl7 sort of conscious purpose to engage in the particular criminal\nl8 violation suggesting knouledge of the criminal statute and\n\nl9 criminal prohibition. All the Miller case does is affirm that\n2o this instruction is not error.

Because\n\n6 the overt act with respect to Annie is, she's saying she's\n\n7 under the age of l8, but the age of consent there is l6, so --\n8 and Kate -- there are a few issues here, so I'll just lay them\n) out.\n\nlo The instruction with Annie is, you knou, there's the\nll age of consent issue with Annie. But skipping to Kate, which\nl2 is No. 4, on line l8, I don't think that should be in there at\nl3 all because that invites them to base an overt act and convict\nl4 the defendant based on Kate's testimony, which the Court has\n\nl5 already instructed that the jury can't. So, I mean, if they\n\nl6 found that this element was satisfied solely with Kate's\n\nl7 testimony, that would be an improper <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.

The\n5 only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is\n\n6 the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.\n\n7 And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the\n8 flight to New Mexico.\n\n9 She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think\nlo it was a litle unclear what may have happened in New Mexico\n\nll based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual\n\nl2 conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are\n\nl3 debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico,\nl4 where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\nl5 Okay. So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at\nl6 least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for\nl7 the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity.

As discussed in the Government’s Motion\nto Dismiss, the cases Maxwell cites do not support the\nexistence of an exception here. All three cases involved\nappeals by intervenors—not parties—seeking to mod-\nify protective orders in civil cases. Pichler v. UNITE,\n585 F.3d 74l, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2oo9) (third party inter-\nvenor foundation appealing order denying motion to\nmodify protective order in civil litigation to allou third\nparty access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v.\nConticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 74l (2d Cir.\nl987) (Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(“CFTC”) acting as third party intervenor appealing\norder denying motion to modify protective order in\ncivil litigation to allou CFTC to obtain discovery ex-\nchanged by parties to civil case permissible because\n“(t]he entire controversy between the CFTC and the\ndefendants in this case was disposed of by the district\ncourt’s denial of the government’s motion to modify the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9626", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019629.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page22 of 37\nl6\n\njudgment appeal whether publicity biased trial ju-\nrors); United States v.

Accordingly, like the protective or-\nder in Caparros, the Order here will still be reviewable\non appeal after entry of final judgment.\n\nIn evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, the Court should\n“not engage in an individualized jurisdictional in-\nquiry,” but instead focus “on the entire category to\nwhich a claim belongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7. The\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order is not\nsubject to interlocutory appeal as “[p]rotective orders\nthat only regulate materials exchanged between the\nparties incident to litigation, like most discovery or-\nders, are neither final orders, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l29l, nor injunctions, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l292(a)(l).” Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nMaxwell nevertheless asks this Court to engage in\nan individualized jurisdictional inquiry to justify her\nimmediate appeal. Contrary to Maxwell’s claims, the\nOrder does not meet the third criterion of the standard\nfor identifying immediately appealable collateral or-\nders, which requires that the order being appealed\nfrom be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a fi-\nnal judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522.\nShe likens her claim here to an appeal of an order\ndenying a motion to reduce bail, arguing that her ap-\npeal “will become moot if review awaits <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and\nsentence.” (Br. l3 (quotation omited)). But that is not\nso.

Ca-\nparros, 8oo F.2d at 25. To the extent Maxwell still\nwishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\ndiscovery for other purposes after entry of final judg-\nment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization\nfrom this Court to do so then. If Maxwell complains\nthat her inability to use criminal discovery materials\nin civil maters may result in premature unsealing or\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, she can likewise raise\nthose claims before this Court on appeal after entry of\nfinal judgment in her criminal case.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates.

Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

The government represented to the Court that it\nhad “contemporaneous documents,” including “diary entries” in support of its case.\n(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense has nou reviewed the discovery produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As explained more fully belou, the discovery contains no\nmeaningful documentary corroboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. As an\nexample, the government produced onl\n3\nThe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that took\nplace over 25 years ago.

Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n? Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago. She will sign them as soon as legal visits resume.\n3 In a leter dated October l3, 2o2o, we asked the government to provide additional discovery including, amon\nother things,\n\nIn light of the serious Brady\ninfractions in recent cases before this Court, and the recent order filed in this case pursuant to Rule 5(F) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (see Dkt. 68), the government’s failure to obtain is curious and\nconceming.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020053.jpg": "Casesb: 2o-68o o88oHAGN ISSCUMENT D2 FileG6Ba3o/PtagPage BO26o45\n\nIn addition, the discovery appears to shou that, Dn\n|\n7 the government did not issue subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until\nafter Epstein’s death. Although the discovery does not include the grand jury subpoenas\nthemselves, the subpoena returns appear to indicate that the government began issuing\nsubpoenas for Ms. Maxwell’s financial information on August l6, 2ol9, six days after\nEpstein’s death, and issued additional subpoenas in the months that folloued. The facts\nstrongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms. Maxwell—who was\nnot named in the Epstein indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in\ntheir custody. The lack of corroboration in the discovery confirms that the case against Ms.\nMaxwell was an afterthought and was reverse engineered based on allegations of 25-year-\nold conduct from a small number of alleged victims.\n\nThus, notwithstanding the statement in the government's bail submission, we have\nbeen provided with no meaningful documentary corroboration in this case. It appears that\nthe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that allegedly took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration only\nreinforces Ms. Maxwell's <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> that she has been falsely accused and strengthens her\nlong-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear her name in court. This\nfactor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms. Maxwell bail.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020072.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BtANAt BEctuMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPagetl Pat 36\ndefendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her\nnatural life in prison. The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020163.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoB3onAeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5i , BilEGH3lo972 he Reigef 3 Ob 9\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020217.jpg": "Cased :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BO l FROG O22o6 24g Fagecd F6l6\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020250.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel6 of 25\nCir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.

Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020770.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel52 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it ls\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o786", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020798.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel8o of 2o8\nA-l76\n' Case l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page 4 of l5\nTerms of the Agreement:\nLi Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to the Indictment as\n\ncurrently pending against him in the l5th Judicial Circuit in and for\n\nPalm Beach County (Case No. 2oo6-cf-oo9495A XXXMB) charging\n\none (l) count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Fl.

MOE: Your Honor, at the very least, the answer to\n23 this can't be no, because a jury could infer intent to engage\n24 in sexual conduct and the return of a flight in aiding and\n25 abeting that.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o837", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020840.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Pagel4 of 22l\n3l33\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl to New Mexico, where/if there was an intent for Jane to engage\n2 in sexual activity.

Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported.\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” $2 Ind. | 2l (emphasis added).

That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four.

A <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020985.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel59 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 2 of 45\n\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o985", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020999.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel73 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury’ —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25.

Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIll. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021006.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel8o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Hrank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear “merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance ls not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021007.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel8l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed.

Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n4 The Defendant also contends that her <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021016.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel9o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2-l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021018.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel92 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here. In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were\nconstructively amended are the same.

See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)). The Defendant “must shou both\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021027.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2ol of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 44 of 45\nwould have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence\npresented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the\nDefendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to\ncreate the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and.\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated.\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021028.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o2 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 45 of 45\ncaptured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced\nby any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021072.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page25 of ll3\n\n4. Under Count Four, it was necessary to prove that Defendant caused Jane to\ntravel to New York with the intent that she would engage in illegal sexual activity\nthat violated New York Penal Law §l3o.55. A juror note plainly indicated that the\njury believed that the sexual activity intended need not have occurred in New\nYork. But the court refused to correct the jurors’ misunderstanding, merely\ndirecting them to the charge which they had in their possession and to which they\nwere already plainly referring when they asked about the “second element” of\n“count four.” Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, to which the\nNote referred, presented the jury with an alternative basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> that was\nentirely distinct from the charges in the Indictment. The Court’s refusal to correct\nthe jury’s obvious misunderstanding, constituted a constructive amendment and/or\na variance from the charges in the Indictment.\n\n5. Defendant’s sentence was predicated on a miscalculation of the guideline\nrange and the court gave no explanation for her decision to sentence Defendant\nabove the range.

From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary\nconfinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District\nCourt denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate\nMaxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell\nwas so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her\noun defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both\nscale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> was\nenormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with\nits terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell\nfrom presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that\nwas central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2oo6 FBI investigation, the terms\nof the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil atorneys in both\nthe VCP and the Government’s investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,\nKate, and Carolyn), were permited to testify under pseudonyms. The result\ntransformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at\nevery turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy\ninterests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021083.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page36 of ll3\n(“promises made by an [AUSA]” in a plea agreement “bind all agents of the\nUnited States government”); Thomas v.

Rather, such offenses could only have been\ngoverned by the l994 version of § 3283, pursuant to which the statute of\nlimitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 years old. And it is\nundisputed that Defendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when\nthe Government charged her in 2o2o.\n\nFor these reasons, Appellant’s convictions under Counts Three and Four\nmust be vacated.\n\nA. Section 3283 Does Not Apply to the Mann Act Violations (Counts Three\nand Four)\n\nUnder Counts Three and Four, the Government charged Defendant with\nsubstantive and conspiracy violations of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), more\nthan l5 years after the fact. To accomplish this, the Government relies on § 3283’s\nextension of the limitations period. But by its text, § 3283 applies only to\n“offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Transportation of a minor or conspiracy to transport in violation of\n§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and\nFour do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a child.” But\nlongstanding legal precedent dictates a narrouer application of § 3283. The\nSupreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “essential\ningredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021106.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Paged9 of ll3\ncrimes. Under this approach, a court “look[s] to the statute defining the crime of\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.” Kawashima v.\nHolder, 565 U.S. 478, 483 (2ol2); see also U.S. v. Taylor, l42 S.Ct. 2ol5, 2o2o\n(2o22) (the categorical approach asks only what the Government is required “‘to\nprove—beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case,” and “precludes...an\ninquiry into hou any particular defendant may commit the crime’).\n\nHere, applying the categorical approach to § 3283 means holding that this\nprovision is inapplicable here. That is because “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child” is not a required element of transporting minors in violation\nof § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same. l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). The offense is\naccomplished once a person “transports” a minor with the requisite knouledge and\nintent; “[t]he government need not prove ... that the unlawful sexual activity\nactually took place.” U.S. v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2ol3).\nThus, Counts Three and Four should have been dismissed.\n\nHouever, to save Counts Three and Four from dismissal, the court rejected\nthis categorical approach altogether and opted instead for a “case-specific” one,\nwhich would permit it to examine whether this particular defendant’s alleged\nconduct “involve[ed] the sexual or physical abuse...of a child.” In so doing, the\ncourt brushed aside the clear weight of authority, which holds that statutes\nemploying “offense...involves” or “offense...involving” language identical to §\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021113.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page66 of ll3\n\nU.S. v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4 (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (Graves, J.); U.S. v. Coutentos, 65l\nF.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll). In Coutentos, a jury found the defendant guilty on two\ncounts: sexual exploitation or atempted sexual exploitation of a minor to produce\nchild pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) and (d)) and possession or atempted\npossession of child pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)). Both\ncounts were untimely unless § 3283 applied. As the Court’s recitation of the facts\nmade clear, the production and possession counts were based on the same\nunderlying conduct: the defendant’s abuse of his granddaughters to create child\npormography. See Coutentos, 65l F.3d at 8l3-l4. Thus, in a factual sense, the\ndefendant’s possession clearly involved the sexual abuse of a child. Nevertheless,\nthe Eighth Circuit, while affirming the production <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, vacated the\npossession <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> on the ground that it was not an “offense involving the\nsexual...abuse of a child” within the precise meaning of § 3283.

No more than the offense of\n\npossessing methamphetamine involves the act of producing it, does\n\nthe offense of child pornography involve the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nThat a producer of child pornography will possess it at the time of the\n\nabuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing\n\nchild pornography itself does not involve an act against a child, l.e.,\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021135.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page88 of ll3\nbrother to be family (#49) and that he did not consider sexual abuse a crime (#25),\nhis answers border on the absurd.\n\nA review of Juror 5o’s statements to the media and hearing testimony\nreveals that, after he retained and was advised by counsel, he took great pains to\ndounplay his prior sexual abuse.

The Jury Note read as\nfollous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation\n\nof Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if\n\nthe intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be\n\nfound guilty under the second element?\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021139.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page92 of ll3\n(Ind. 4] l8 at Al28) and specified that the relevant criminal offense was a\n“violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. §l9b at Al28. And\nthe Government consistently represented to the court, in numerous conferences\nand filings, that a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under the Mann Act counts had to be based on an\nintent or an agreement to violate New York Penal Law §l3o.55. See, e.g.,\nll/l/2o2l Tr. 68:2- 4; Dkt. 4lo-l at 52; and Tr. 2775:3-6.\n\nIt follous, then, that evidence that Jane traveled to any other state besides\nNew York and engaged in sexual activity, even if illegal under that state’s laws,\nwould be insufficient, by itself, to convict Maxwell of Count Four. If Maxwell\nwere convicted on Counts Three or Four based solely on such conduct, that\nwould be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65; Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8; Roshko, 969 F.2d at 4-\n6.\n\n2. There is a Substantial Likelihood that. Maxwell Was Convicted\non Counts Three and Four Based on Conduct Not Charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThere is a substantial likelihood that Defendant was convicted on Count\n\nFour based solely on conduct in New Mexico.\n\nThe jurors were not given the Indictment and the jury charge failed to\ninclude that the relevant interstate travel “as charged in the Indictment” was\ntravel “from Florida to New York, New York,” despite a defense request. Dkt.\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021140.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page93 of ll3\n4lo-l at l9; Tr. 2758:23-276o:9.\n\nCount Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane. Jane recalled\none trip to New Mexico when she was “l5 or l6.” Tr. 32l:6- 32l:l3. She flew\nto New Mexico with Epstein and Maxwell and stayed at Epstein’s ranch. Tr.\n32l:l4-322:6., and, while there, she was sexually abused. Tr. 322:7-323:l9.\n\nBased on Jane’s testimony and the Note, there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the jury improperly based its <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> solely on the sexual abuse that\nJane experienced in New Mexico. The jurors had the mistaken impression that\nit would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found\nthat Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico,\neven though such conduct was not and could not have been “sexual activity in\nviolation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.”\n\nThe corroborating evidence supports the theory that the jury did not\ncredit Jane’s testimony that Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s\nsexual abuse in New York and was instead focused on her involvement in the\nNew Mexico conduct. The most important piece of evidence corroborating\nJane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot, Dave Rodgers.\nSee GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence\noffered at trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York\nand New Mexico and when those trips may have taken place. According to the\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021141.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page94 of ll3\n\nflight logs, there were only two trips that Jane may have taken while she was\nunder the relevant age of l7. The first from Palm Beach to New York\n(Teterboro) on November ll, l996 (GX-662-R at 44) and the second from New\nYork (Teterboro) to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997, both when Jane\nwas l6 (GX- 662-R at 48). The critical difference between the two trips was\nthat Maxwell was not a passenger on the first trip to New York but was a\npassenger on the second trip to New Mexico.\n\nGiven the text of the Note, it is likely that the jurors decided that there\nwas no corroborating evidence that Maxwell was present for, or helped to\narrange, any of Jane’s trips to New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate\nthat Maxwell was present for Jane’s trip to New Mexico. As a result, the jury\nbegan evaluating Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip to see if it\nsupported a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under Count Four, which led to the question posed by\nthe Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Maxwell on the\nsubstantive enticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that\nthe only corroborating evidence linking Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a\nflight log shouing that she was present on the trip but said nothing about\nwhether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced” Jane to take the trip.\nHence, the acquital on Count Two. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if\n\n7l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021142.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page95 of ll3\nthey found that Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place, they could convict\nher on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count\nFour. Hence, the question in the Jury Note.\n\nThus, it was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> under Count Four. The Court’s refusal to do so alloued the jury to\nmodify the essential elements of the charged offense and created a substantial\nlikelihood that Maxwell was convicted of a crime other than the one alleged in\nthe Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted\nMaxwell on Count Four based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a\nsubstantial likelihood that they improperly convicted her on the related\nconspiracy count (Count Three) based on the same conduct. The substantive\ntransportation offense charged in Count Four was the object of the conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law.\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021143.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page96 of ll3\n\nC.

The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction.

Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021323.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l49 3536o38, Pagel5l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021324.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 5o. 3536o38, Pagel52 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 348\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021391.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Page2l9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.?° Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.”\nB.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.

No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials.

OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

BACKGROUND !\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and\ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage\ngirls. Starting in l994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to\nengage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual\ntopics and sexual abuse. Until about 2oo4, this patern of sexual abuse\ncontinued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in\nvarious locations in the United States.\n\nl. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nIn September 2oo7, follouing state and federal investigations\ninto allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered\ninto an NPA with USAO-SDEL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead\nguilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida\n' Unless otherwise noted, the follouing facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial\nand described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678\nF.3d 2o8, 2lo-ll (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\nentered after a jury trial, the | ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the\nlight most favorable to the Government.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l799", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021809.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-l, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Pagel5 of 26\napproach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”*? We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o. Second,\nlegislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly.

The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment.

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2, The nature and seriousness of the offense; '*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4.

The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023160.jpg": "Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances.

USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl3 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023162.jpg": "defendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023165.jpg": "flexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a. l96\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.jpg": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738.

The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing.

The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV.

OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.jpg": "and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!>\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.jpg": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.jpg": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.7** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.jpg": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.74? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023229.jpg": "Bill of Rights in the VRRA.?® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. 74\nB.

The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o). The relevant text of the VRRA\nis set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section l.B of this Report.\n268 l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). Although nine congressional hearings were held between l996 and\n2oo3 concerning amending the Constitution to address victims’ rights, neither chamber of Congress voted on\nlegislation proposing an amendment.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.jpg": "and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c.(3). Under the 2oo5 Guidelines, the term “should” means that “the\nemployee is expected to take the action or provide the service described unless there is an appropriate, articulable\nreason not to do so.” Jd., Art.

For example, in Atorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84 (Md. 2ol5), the\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster\nfamily about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the mater\nwas a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived\nthe victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution.

Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.’”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\na9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Included was a book\norder receipt for titles such as SM ol: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for\n\nErotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their\nOwners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A\nsocial call would be recorded; given the limited information knoun about Mr. Epstein,\nknouledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with\nhim.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27286", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028899.jpg": "; er\n| v\nia 5\na * * * . a :\nMystery money man faces soliciting charge\nca\noe\nBP RICOLE JANOS Epstein was indicted last week by a convictions. at\nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer state grand jury, according to state at- Houever, checks of court records |. -\nA part-time Palm Beacher who has torney’s spokesman Mike Edmondson. here and in New York Sunday turned up\nsocialized with Donald Trump, Bill Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment no such convictions. ,~ ou\nClinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed containing the allegations remained Epstein could not be reached.

An Aggravated Assault <span class=\"highlight\">Conviction</span> Might Subject the Client to Sex-Registration\nThere is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated assault, E.S.A. § 784.o2l(l)(b), will expose\nthe client to registration obligations under the Megan’s Law statutes, either as currently writen,\nor as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but\nnot limited to, ones whete he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the\nplea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious :\nbehavior under F.S.A. § 8oo.o4 or sexual batery under F.S.A. § 794.oll.\nAs my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious\nunintended result of a plea to felony aggravated assault is the possible registration in his placc of\nresidency. The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person convicted ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a i\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person convicted ... ina ;\nfedcral, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under :\nthis statute,” Failure to register is a crime. l4 VLC. § l722(d), Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently acecssible only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May l5, 2oo6, at\nhtp:/Awww.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article home?id=l7296624.!\nUnder current law, a plea to aggravated assault will also likely subject the client to\nregistration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York }\nunder the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grou. In\nl999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March ll,\n2oo2, seven new offenses were added, i\n: A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be |\nsubject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated assault - Oklahoma and\nMontana. |\n|\nOklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of assault with intent to commit a felomy, in |\nviolation of 2l Oki, St. Ann, § 68l \"if the offense involved sexual assault.” See, 57 OkL.

See, N.Y. Corr.

The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A, §§ l6-22-lo3, |\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current |\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 5\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.

Epstein, 53, \"did solicit, induce,\n\n| entice or procure\" prostitution with girls, who were between l4 and l6 years old, on at\n\nleast three occasions between Aug. l, 2oo4, and Oct. 3l, 2oo5.\n\n|\n\n| Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,ooo\n\n| bond. His atorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-\n\ndegree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the\n\n| girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date\nwill be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, a third-\ndegree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,ooo fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has ouned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot\nwaterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since l99o.\nThe indictment folloued an ll-lmonth sexual batery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais\nthat began in March 2oo5 alter a Woiun told police tiai der L4-ycui-cis wie podusinci\nmay have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York\nCity, and on Haley Robson, 2o, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by\nEpstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to\nEpstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor\nRobson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and l7 witnesses concerning the\nmassages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone\nnumbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according\nto police. Epstein would then pay the girls $2oo or $3oo, police said.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 66 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32lo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032116.jpg": "re than $loo,ooo Eee\ning John Kerry’s presidential bid, om po\n‘ill Richardson and the Senate bids yo |\ner Dodd and Charles Schumer. deca,\n| e e\nlst Vinics etectives\n| a fuel extraordinary desires. enough dirt on the girls to make\n| See In March 2oo5, a worried mother prosecutors skeptical.

I have to say in this instance, your\noffice along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not\nadequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and\nprestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He\nlived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the\ncorrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be\nfacing the death penalty. Hou can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of\ngirls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and nou be a free man?! Hou?!! Because he is\nrich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these\ngirls makes me sick. Nou, I understand the pressure of taking on a pouerful person with\nunlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> is beter than\nnone can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor\ndid you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your\noffice could have put this monster away for at least 2o years, if not life.\n\nI’m sure you have read Conchita Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this\nmonsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as\na cautionary tale on hou not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Nou,\nI do not knou the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, hou much hush’\nmoney was paid out, ect ect. But I do knou that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have\nraped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn’t be alloued to do the\nsame thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you\nlegally could have to put this man in prison. Houever after researching the case, it seems\nyou failed to come doun with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s\noffice and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!\nIt would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the\n\njustice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose\nto defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your litle sister\nor daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American\npeople deserve beter, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the\nanger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the\nwhole DA’s office nee“ to knou this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!\n\n-A Concerned Patriot\n\np.s.

As the PBPD well knew, in 2oo3, Alessi was filmed taking\nmoney from Epstein’s home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully\nentering Epstein’s home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admited to\nthe PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,\nstealing cash and atempting to steal Epstein’s licensed handgun (which in fact\nwent missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report\ndetailing Alessi’s confession. Also knoun to the PBPD, but omited from the\nPolice Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to\nkill himself.

BACKGROUND!\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated,\nand contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nwomen and underage girls. Starting in l994, Maxwell\ngroomed numerous young women to engage in sexual\nactivity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions\nof sexual topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2oo4,\nthis patern of sexual abuse continued as Maxwell\nprovided Epstein access to underage girls in various\nlocations in the United States.\n\n' Unless otherwise noted, the follouing facts are drawn from\nthe evidence presented at trial and described in the light most\nfavorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678\nF.3d 2o8, 2lo-ll (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“Because this is an appeal from a\njudgment of <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are\ndrawn from the trial evidence and described in the light most\nfavorable to the Government.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000076.tif": "l3a\n\nthose offenses that were commited before the\nenactment into law of the provision. On both points,\nwe disagree and hold that the District Court correctly\ndenied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the charges as\nuntimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the application of a statute\nof limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors. The\nDistrict Court properly applied Weingarten v. United\nStates.?! In Weingarten, we explained that Congress\nintended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\napproach as opposed to a “categorical approach.””?\nWe see no reason to depart from our reasoning in\nWeingarten. Accordingly, the question presented here\nis whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on\nthe facts of the case.

Supp. 3d 299, 3l3 l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l).\n\n# The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory inter-\npretation that requires courts to look \"only to the statutory\ndefinitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration\npurposes.

We\nproperly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of the\nconditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the\ncategorical approach. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First,\n“[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the offense and its\nlegal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-\n6o. Second, legislative history suggests that Congress intended\n§ 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 6o. Third, a case-specific\napproach would not produce practical difficulties or potential\nunfairness.

Specifically, Maxwell argues that testimony\nabout a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented\nthe jury with another basis for <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, which is\ndistinct from the charges in the Indictment.

Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to transport a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan essential ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 238l9, 2327\n(2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the ques-\ntion, the Second Circuit has strongly suggested that\nMaxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v.\nUnited States, 865 F.3d 48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the\nSecond Circuit discussed at length hou the text,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000127.tif": "64a\ncontext, and history of § 3283 shou that Congress\nintended courts to apply the statute using a case-\nspecific approach. The Third Circuit reached the same\nconclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the\nreasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> contexts of criminal sentencing\nand immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for application of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Id. at 59. “The language of § 32838,\nby contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That\nlinguistic expansion indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case. This reading accords with a robust\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000128.tif": "65a\nlegislative history indicating that Congress intended\nto apply § 3288 to a wide range of crimes against\nchildren. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o; Schneider,\n8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach\ndo not apply here either. For statutes dealing with\nprior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves\n‘practical’ purposes: It promotes judicial and adminis-\ntrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past\nconvictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact.”\nMoncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3). In\nthe context of § 3283, there is no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> to\nassess, and the jury will determine in the first instance\nwhether “the defendant engaged in the applicable\nabusive conduct.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell\nnonetheless contends that using a _ case-specific\napproach for § 3283 would be impractical because the\nGovernment would need to prove conduct beyond the\nelements of the offense. It may be true that this\napproach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense\npresents factual issues (including, at least, when the\nalleged conduct took place). This is not a serious\npractical problem and does not justify seting aside the\nstatute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States,\n346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this Court to cast\nWeingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges\naddressed a statute that extended the limitations\nperiod for defrauding the United States during the\nSecond World War. In that case, the Supreme Court\nfirst concluded that making false statements at an\nimmigration hearing was not subject to the extended\nlimitations period because it lacked any pecuniary\nelement as required by the statute. Id. at 22l. Then, as\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000146.tif": "83a\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court\nwill follou the well-worn path of others in this District\nand reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her\nmotion then.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous\n\ncharges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third\ncount of the $l superseding indictment as multiplicitous\nis also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government\nhas alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a\nsingle offense as an offense multiple times, in separate\ncounts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been\ncommited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45\n(2d Cir. l999). “The multiplicity doctrine is based upon\nthe double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its\nlegislative authorization by imposing multiple punish-\nments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian,\n82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987) (cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> or acquital,\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against\nsimultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so\nlong as no more than one punishment is eventually\nimposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o,\n355 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this\nCircuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.”\nUnited States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272 (PGG), 2ol4\nWL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting\ncases). The Court therefore denies Maxwell’s motion to\ndismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000203.tif": "3\n\nAmicus NACDL urges the Court to grant this petition\nand resolve the conflict among the circuits to ensure that\nthe government keeps its promises.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Department of Justice (the “Department”)\nroutinely limits the scope of its plea agreements to the\nspecific United States Atorney’s Office (USAO) that is a\nparty to the agreement. Prosecutors in other districts and\nother parts of the Department could therefore later charge\nthe defendant for the same or related conduct. Where,\nas here, the government chooses not to adopt limiting\nlanguage, a court should not negate its bargained-for\npromise to the defendant and instead enforce the language\nas writen. Amicus urges the Court to grant the petition\nto resolve the split among the circuits and ensure that\ndefendants and their counsel can rely on the promises\nmade by the United States in its writen agreements.\n\nl. Defendants should be able to rely on the government’s\npromises and courts should not hesitate to enforce\nthem.\n\nLike any party to any contract, defendants in criminal\ncases rely on the promises made by the Department. And\ndefendants give up a lot in return. A defendant entering\ninto a plea agreement forgoes his constitutional right to a\ntrial by jury and right to appeal, faces the near certainty\nof a prison sentence and loss of freedom, agrees to pay\nfinancial penalties through fines and forfeiture, and faces\nthe myriad collateral effects of a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> after\nserving the sentence.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo2o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000204.tif": "4\n\n“The reality is that plea bargains have become so\ncentral to the administration of the criminal justice\nsystem that defense counsel have responsibilities in the\nplea bargain process, responsibilities that must be met to\nrender the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth\nAmendment requires in the criminal process at critical\nstages.” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. l34, l43 (2ol2). That\nresponsibility, borne by NACDL’s members, requires\ndefense counsel to explain the benefits and drawbacks of\na plea agreement to their clients.\n\nAs a practical mater, every criminal defendant\nhopes that a plea agreement will end their exposure\nto future prosecution for the same or related conduct.\nDefense counsel must explain to their clients that while\na plea agreement ensures that the client is not charged\nfor the same or related conduct in that district, most plea\nagreements expose the client to prosecution in other\ndistricts. It creates an impossible situation if defense\ncounsel must nou explain to their clients that the court\nmay later excuse the Department from its promises.\n\nGuilty pleas must be knouing and voluntary.\nMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466 (l969).

These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atomey, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023090.tif": "as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

He specified that “a\ntwo-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal\ninterest in the case. (Emphasis added.) With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote\nthat the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>” and retained the reference to a\nRule ll(c) plea.

In a September 6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a\nRule ll(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia told OPR\nthat Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule ll(c) plea.\n56\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o94", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023159.tif": "him/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; '*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4. The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\nJurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023160.tif": "Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023161.tif": "that come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” Ifa substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl93 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustamnable <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023162.tif": "defendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others. USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\n2. The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5. The desirability of prompt and certain disposition of\nthe case;\n6. The likelihood of obtaining a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> at trial;\n7. The probable effect on witnesses;\n8. The probable sentence or other consequences if the\ndefendant is convicted;\n9. The public interest in having the case tried rather\nthan disposed of by a guilty plea;\nlo. The expense of trial and appeal;\nll. The need to avoid delay in the disposition of other\npending cases; and\nl2. The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution.\n4. USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023165.tif": "flexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a l96\ncrime,\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.tif": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).?°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing.

The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate.

For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span> against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.tif": "and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.tif": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.tif": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.4? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it .. . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.tif": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023229.tif": "Bill of Rights in the VRRA.?® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. 74\nB. Enumerated Rights\nThe CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as “‘a person directly and proximately harmed\n\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.””®\nInitially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime\nvictims the follouing eight rights:\n\n(l) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.\n\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public\n\ncourt proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or\n\nof any release or escape of the accused.\n\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court\n\nproceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\n\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be\n\nmaterially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\n\nproceeding.\n\n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the\n\ndistrict court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole\n\nproceeding.\n\n(5) The reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\n\nGovernment in the case.\n263 See l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o).

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a <span class=\"highlight\">conviction</span>. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.tif": "and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*?! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”4°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c.(3).

Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses\nRelied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits.\n\nVirtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable\ncause affidavit has a background that casts significant doubt on whether the\nwitness is sufficiently credible to support a finding of probable cause, let alone to\nsustain what would be the State’s burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the\nwitnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which\nundercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence\nwas submited to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the\nprobable cause affidavit, or released to the public. Belou we address solely the\nomited criminal histories. Follouing that, we list other factors that make each\nwitness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at\ntrial — all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omited from the\nPolice Report, the probable cause affidavit and the public disclosure.\n\n6. Juan Alessi: While the Police Report (at page 57) and the probable cause\naffidavit (at page 2l) contain assertions by Alessi which allegedly support the\nbringing of criminal charges, omited is the evidence revealing Alessi’s\nevident mental instability; prior criminal conduct against Epstein; and bias\ntouards Epstein. As the PBPD well knew, in 2oo3, Alessi was filmed taking\nmoney from Epstein’s home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully\nentering Epstein’s home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admited to\nthe PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,\nstealing cash and atempting to steal Epstein’s licensed handgun (which in fact\nwent missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report\ndetailing Alessi’s confession. Also knoun to the PBPD, but omited from the\nPolice Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to\nkill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination\nof credibility, and was specifically knoun to Det.
