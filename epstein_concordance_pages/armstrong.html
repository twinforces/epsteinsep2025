As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

The Complete Inspector General’s Report, as Well as the Other Reports\nRequested Are Necessary for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense\n. Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.l99l) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F.\nSupp. 2d 337 (S.D.

The Requested Records Are Not “Material” to Preparing a Defense and Are\nSought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification\n\nAll of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not “material to preparing a defense”\nunder Rule l6, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the\nGovernment’s false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, l4). Thomas is not\nentitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—\nthat would aid in that nullification effort because Rule l6 only entitles a defendant to discovery\nfor purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the\ndecision to prosecute.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nAn item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is\ndiscoverable under Rule l6(a)(l)(E) only if it “is material to preparing the defense.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(a)(l)(E). “It is [a defendant’s] burden to make a prima facie shouing that documents sought\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense.” United States v. Rigas, 258 F.\nSupp. 2d 299, 3o7 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo3) (citing United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 894\n(S.D.N.Y. l99l)). As noted above, an item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6\n“if it could be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” Stevens, 985 F.2d at\nll8o-8l. The defendant must “offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested\nevidence is material.” Rigas, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (internal citation omited).\n\nAs the Supreme Court held in United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, while Rule l6 authorizes\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022081.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l9 of 34\nwere not on trial).\n\nThomas’s efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for\nhis oun criminal actions plainly sound in nullification. See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84;\nLevin, 2ol6 WL 299o83l, at *l2. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the\ndefendant commited the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or\ncompromise from the jury. The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the\nnullification evidence precluded in <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span> and its progeny. See <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 462-\n63 (defendant not entitled to discovery on race of other narcotics defendants to aid in selective\nprosecution claim); United States v. Delacruz, No. l4 Cr. 8l5 (KBF), 2ol5 WL 22ll943, at *4\n(S.D.N.Y. May l2, 2ol5) (rejecting defendant’s “demands for general information and statistics\nrelating to the Government’s use of sting operations”); United States v. Floyd, No. 99 Cr. o234\n(DAB), l999 WL 476438, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, l999) (rejecting discovery request for\n“background data, records and investigative reports” of the New York City Police Department\n(“NYPD”) as well as information about NYPD officers’ conduct in other cases); Defreitas, 2oll\nWL 3l7964, at *lo (rejecting discovery demands related to a “factual impossibility” defense to a\nconspiracy charge). It is the Court’s “duty to forestall or prevent” jury nullification. Manzano,\n945 F.3d at 627 (holding that “District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification\narguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could\nargue jury nullification.”); see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984)\n(criticizing trial court for inviting nullification by permiting the defendants to mount a “political\ndefense” and stating that it was an “erroneous assumption that good motive for commiting a crime\nis inconsistent with criminal intent’).\n\nIn sum, much of the additional discovery Thomas seeks in his motion relates to legally\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022091.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 29 of 34\ndiscovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022092.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3o of 34\none,” id., as the defendant must “overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of\nfederal prosecutors, and ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they\nhave properly discharged their official duties.’” United States v. Sanders, l7 F. Supp. 2d l4l, l44\n(E.D.N.Y. l998) (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 464), aff'd, 2ll F.3d 7ll (2d Cir. 2ooo).\n\nA defendant claiming selective prosecution must present “clear evidence” that the decision\nto prosecute not only (l) “had a discriminatory effect” but was also (2) “motivated by a\ndiscriminatory purpose.” <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l73\n(2d Cir. 2oo3); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. l992); United States v. Moon, 7l8\nF.2d l2lo, l229 (2d Cir. l983). “The discriminatory effect prong requires a shouing that\n‘similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted.’” Alameh, 34l\nF.3d at l73 (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited; alteration\nincorporated). Where a defendant “has not shoun that the Government prosecuted him because\nof” his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. /d.\n\nIn order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer\n“some evidence tending to shou the existence of the essential elements of the defense.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v.

Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 47o (affidavits “recount[ing]\nhearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not sufficient to\njustify discovery); Berrios, 5ol F.2d at l2ll (affidavit from defendant and atorney that they\n“‘believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went\nunprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 34l F.3d at l74 (defendant’s statistical analysis was\ninsufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim).\n\nDe Discussion\n\nThomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or\n“discriminatory application” claim. He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v. Lewis, 5l7 F.3d 2o, 27 (lst Cir. 2oo8). Thomas\nalleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6 wherein officers failed to\nconduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide,” and one of the four\nofficers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to\nconduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022095.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 33 of 34\nprosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l23o (“to engage\nin a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or\nsurmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

Accordingly, courts routinely and correctly preclude defendants from raising\nthese arguments at trial. See Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82 (“[W]e agree with the district court’s\ndecision to resolve for itself whether the government’s conduct was lawful and to prevent Regan\nfrom presenting evidence on that subject.”); United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG), Dkt.\n622 (precluding argument regarding propriety of Government’s prosecution), United States v.\nStewart, Cr. No. o3-7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2oo4) (granting\nmotion to preclude the defendant from “presenting arguments or evidence that would invite the\njury to question the Government’s motives in investigating and indicting” the defendant); United\nStates v. Larkin, No. l2-CR-3l9, 2ol7 WL 9289l5, at *3 (D. Nev. Mar. 8, 2ol7) (“Defendant will\nbe precluded from presenting evidence regarding the government’s motive for prosecution in the\ninstant case as such evidence is not relevant.”); United States v.

United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. 456, 468 (l996). “[A] defendant\nwho seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must shou some evidence of both\ndiscriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.” United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863\n(2oo2). Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of\nfalse count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submited false documents in\nother circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in\nany protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.\nSee Motion at lo. Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his\nprosecution.\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the\nsubmission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery\nrelated to selective prosecution, is DENIED.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.””\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Armstrong</span>, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7°4 A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o3 See, e.g., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 US. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.
