The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s\nmotion without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n2. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nMaxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment\nare untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and\nthereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided\nby § 3283.l9 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot\napply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to § 3283 that extended the statute of\nlimitations to those offenses that were commited before the enactment\ninto law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o. Second,\nlegislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 6o.\nThird, a case-specific approach would not produce practical difficulties or potential\nunfairness.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate.

The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000348.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page6oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 6\nMultiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information\nagainst the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\nconviction. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v.

Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely\nthe presumptions and the § 3l42(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be\ndetained.”’).\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000433.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 22 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page3of9\nHon.

And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001002.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGuisnt DOU 22o FilecoOAI3o2P aPage aB26lol9\n\nat *l (S.D.N.Y.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b).

And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001521.jpg": "Casese:2(@2OrroeGGo32INo Damuument@ AietO/GR2 Regpe2zsatB3\nincorporated herein.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001758.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 52 Filed o9/o2/2o Page 7 of 8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 7\nCC\nes.\nFurther, and as this Court knous, ample Second Circuit authority supports staying a civil case\npending the resolution of a related criminal case. See SEC v. Blaszezak, No. l7-CV-39l9 (AJN),\n2ol8 WL 3olo9l, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2))). Among other things, the stay\nvindicates the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil\ncase and then “conforming” their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the\ncivil case.

Given that the\nMaterial has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court’s\nOrder, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this\nCourt has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court’s Protective\nOrder. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues\nrelated to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion “that neither it\nnor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or\npermissible in civil cases.” Doc. # 33 at 7.

United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974) (“[A]n indictment is sufficient if it,\nfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge\nagainst which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquital or conviction in bar\nof future prosecutions for the same offense.”); Fed.R.Crim.P.7(c). An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

R. Crim. P. 49.l(d) provides that “a court may order that a filing be made under seal\nwithout redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing\nto file a redacted version for the public record.” While the Second Circuit has recognized a\npresumption of access under both common law and the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, it is appropriate to\npermit the filing of documents under seal if “countervailing factors” in the common law\nframework or “higher values” in the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> framework so demand.

That would be justice. Obviously her\nlawyers knou’s where she is, someone should stick them up to bateries untill we\nfind out where she is.”\n“SHE'S HERE in #Massachusets ?!

R. Crim. P. 49.l(d) provides that “a court may order that a filing be made under seal\nwithout redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing\nto file a redacted version for the public record.” While the Second Circuit has recognized a\npresumption of access under both common law and the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, it is appropriate to\npermit the filing of documents under seal if “countervailing factors” in the common law\nframework or “higher values” in the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> framework so demand.

That was the point I was\n\n8 making on this case.\n\n9 So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case\nlo for bail.

In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the treatment of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n69. Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 3 of 22\nDefendant did not appeal the Court’s determination that detention was required, and she has been\nincarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nI.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v.

By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l22 Filed ol/25/2l Page 4 of 9\n\nMs. Maxwell, pursuant to the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution and\nFed.

Count Three of the Superseding Indictment again charges Ms. Maxwell\nwith the same crime: conspiracy to commit a crime against the United States in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 37l. Id. 99 l4-l7. The only difference between the two counts is the purported crime\nunderlying the § 37l conspiracy charged.

In Count Three, it is\na violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (transporting minors with intent to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity). /d. {| l5-l6. This minor variance is insufficient to avoid the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s\ndouble jeopardy bar.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when a single offense is alleged in more than one\ncount.” United States v.

The object of both, as claimed by the government, is to\nfirst entice and then to transport minors across state lines for the purpose of illegal sexual\nactivity. If the conspiracy to entice fails there would, logically, be no one to transport.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe government has alleged the same conspiracy twice in violation of the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). An indictment that fails to allege the essential elements of the crime\ncharged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Russell v.

Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o). Had the government\nwaited until that time, it might have been unable to meet its arbitrary July 2 deadline, and its\npress conference touting the indictment and arrest of Ms. Maxwell might have had slightly less\n' The fact that Ms. Maxwell herself is neither Black nor Hispanic does not deprive of her of standing to raise this\nchallenge. “[T]he Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a\nfair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he\nhimself belongs.” Holland v. Hlinois, 493 U.S. 474, 477 (l99o).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5 of l3\nimpact. But the government would have avoided violating Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nright. Its failure to do so mandates dismissal of the indictment.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, the government filed a sealed indictment of Ms. Maxwell in the\nManhatan Division of this Court. The government has conceded that Ms. Maxwell’s indictment\nwas obtained using a grand jury seated in White Plains, apparently with jurors drawn exclusively\nfrom the White Plains Division. At no point, houever, has the government alleged that Ms.\nMaxwell engaged in any unlawful conduct in the White Plains Division, or that any overt act in\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracies occurred in the White Plains Division. To the contrary,\nthe only specific location within this District that is referenced in the indictment is Epstein’s\nresidence on the Upper East Side of Manhatan, the location at which Ms. Maxwell allegedly\nintended for Minor Victim-l to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Sealed\nIndictment (“Indictment”), Dkt. No. l (filed Jun. 29, 2o2o), at ff 6a, llb, l7b.\n\nThe indictment of Ms. Maxwell, and apparently others in the wake of the COVID-l9\npandemic, was a deviation from the established practice of indicting defendants in the division\nwhere the offense is alleged to have occurred and where the case will be tried. As a result of the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic, the government apparently chose to stop using the Manhatan Master\nWheel and to indict Ms. Maxwell using a White Plains grand jury.\n\nB. This District’s Jury Plan\n\nThe Jury Selection and Service Act of l968 mandates that each federal district court\n“devise and place into operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit jurors.”\n28 U.S.C. § l863(a). This District’s current plan was adopted in 2oo9. See Amended Plan for\nthe Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors in the United States District Court for the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of l3\nreturn the questionnaire (and who are found to be qualified as jurors). /d., Art. lV.A. As with\nthe master wheels, two separate qualified jury wheels are maintained: one for Manhatan and\none for White Plains. When jurors are needed, names are drawn at random from these wheels,\nand summonses are sent to those whose names are drawn. /d., Art. IV.C; Reyes, 934 F. Supp. at\n556.\n\nIn United States v. Balde, a case currently pending in this District before Judge Failla, the\ndefendant recently submited, in connection with a similar challenge to the use of a White Plains\ngrand jury in a Manhatan case, an analysis from jury composition expert Jeffrey Martin, who\nanalyzed the racial and ethnic composition of the master and qualified jury wheels for Manhatan\nand White Plains. See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v.\nBalde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l (filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).\nBecause the jury wheels are emptied and refilled only every four years, follouing a presidential\nelection, and the defendant in Balde, like Ms. Maxwell, was indicted in June 2o2o, Ms.\nMaxwell’s grand jury was presumably drawn from the same wheels Mr. Martin analyzed.\n\nMr. Martin found significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons within\nthe White Plains qualified jury wheel—not only when compared to the eligible juror population\nin the Manhatan counties (Martin Decl. {] 6l-62, 69-7o), but also when compared to the eligible\njuror population of the District as a whole (id. {| 59-6o, 67-68).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantees a criminal defendant a grand jury selected from a fair\ncross-section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 53o (l975). Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity applies to the grand jury that indicted her. See, e.g., United States v. Osorio, 8ol F.\nSupp. 966, 973-74 (D. Conn. l992) (rejecting argument that Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s fair cross-\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l3\nsection protection does not apply to grand juries). Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.\nl996).\n\nWhile Duren did not define which community is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,\nit is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page ll of l3\n\nThus, regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel is compared to the\neligible juror population of the Manhatan Division or that of the entire District, Black and\nHispanic jurors are systematically underrepresented. Ms. Maxwell has therefore made a prima\nfacie shouing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.\n\nAccordingly, the government has the burden of shouing that atainment of a fair cross-\nsection would have been incompatible with a significant state interest. The government cannot\ndo so. To the extent that the government asserts a significant state interest in containing\nCOVID-l9, it cannot shou that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible\nwith that interest. As noted above, a Manhatan grand jury convened as early as June 25, 2o2o;\nthere appears to have been no reason, other than a publicity-driven desire to arrest Ms. Maxwell\non the anniversary of the Epstein indictment, why the government could not have waited until\nthat time. The indictment therefore violates Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right and should\nbe dismissed.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Mark.

Ms. Maxwell surmises, but does not knou,\nthat the Jane Doe in this mater is so called Accuser-l.\n\nWhen it became clear that Ms. Maxwell (having been indicted) would exercise her Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Privilege against self-incrimination and it was therefore in the government’s tactical\nl8\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2526\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 24 of 26\ninterest to stop what would have been a one-way discovery process in favor of Ms. Maxwell, the\ngovernment moved to intervene, representing to Magistrate Judge Freeman, among other things,\nthat:\n\ne “should discovery in civil action go forward, multiple witnesses or potential\nwitnesses at the criminal trial would be subject to deposition”\n\ne “any concern regarding the potential delay of this civil suit is outweighed by the\nconcern that Maxwell would seek to assert her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights rather\nthan submit to a deposition in the civil action, and that depositions of other\nwitnesses could potentially interfere with the criminal prosecution”\n\ne “permiting any discovery to proceed in this lawsuit would enable Maxwell to\nseek a preview of trial testimony in the criminal case, and would afford her with a\nbroader array of discovery than she is entitled to in the criminal case”\n\ne “a complaint concerning sexual abuse of minors by Epstein and Maxwell will\ninevitably implicate documents, witnesses, and other evidence that overlaps with\nthe criminal mater, whether or not the plaintiff in this action—or the conduct she\nalleges—has any direct connection to the charges in the Indictment”\n\nCase No. 2o-cv-484, Dkt. 8o.\n\nThese admissions make clear that the government was aware of the substantial overlap\nbetween the allegations it investigated more than a decade before this Indictment. The sharp\ncontrast between the government’s actions in this Jane Doe civil mater, and the Annie Farmer\ncivil mater, the Giuffre mater, and the Ransome mater also establish a strong inference that as\nlong as the government stood to gain a tactical advantage by delaying the indictment (the sought-\nafter deposition in the Farmer civil litigation), it would not move to intervene. Houever, where\nthe government’s tactical advantage was lost or threatened (Jane Doe) it would shut the case\ndoun.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court dismiss the Indictment because of the prejudicial\n\nand tactical delay by the government in prosecuting this case.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l39 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n2222+ eX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nVv. :\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, NOTICE OF MOTION\nDefendant.

Int’! Tel. & Tel.\nCorp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), and the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, to suppress all evidence the\ngovernment obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to [I and to\ndismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5\nand 6 sets forth the facts relevant to this motion. Ms. Maxwell incorporates those facts by\nreference here.\n\nIn summary, the government obtained MY file, including the\nee, by way of a grand jury subpoena enforced through an ex parte\nproceeding befor lls\nRee. Although the government claimed not to knou what was in\na file and that A had no role in instigating the investigation of\nMaxwell, both of these representations to I were false.\n\nIn turn, the government issucd 3l i io thc\nRen. Sc Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and\nDismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex. C, at 3. The government could have been, but was not, more\ntargeted in its approach. The government has not provided Maxwell with a copy of the subpoena,\nbut the record shous that the subpoena was incredibly broad and, as explained belou, ultimately\nunlawful.\n\nThe subpoena violated the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> because it was overbroad and because it\neffected a warrantless search and seizure of material in which Maxwell had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. Moreover, by securing a modification of the Protective Order through a\nsecret, ex parte proceeding, the government violated Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 22\nF.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), which required the government to give Maxwell notice and an\nopportunity to be heard on its request. And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the\nguarantee of confidentiality provided by the Protective Order, the government trampled on\nMaxwell’s Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke\nin reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the Protective Order.\n\nThis Court should (l) suppress all evidence the government obtained from [A\nand any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions\nand all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The government’s violation of the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires suppression.\n\nThe Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. The “Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> provides protection against a grand jury subpoena\nduces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,\n4lo U.S. l, ll-l2 (l973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 2ol U.S. 43, 76 (l9o6), abrogated in part on\nother grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (l964)).\n\nThe government engages in a “search” for Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> purposes when its conduct\nencroaches on an individual’s legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protects people, not places.”). Absent an\nexception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 22\nCarpenter v. United States, l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l3 (2ol8) (holding that an “official intrusion into\n[the] private sphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported by probable\ncause’’). “[A] compulsory production of. . . private books and papers . . . is the equivalent of a\nsearch and seizure—and an unreasonable search and seizure—within the meaning of the fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.” Boyd v United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6, 634-35 (l886), overruling in part on other\ngrounds as recognized in Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 39l, 4o7-o8 (l976).\n\nFinally, “The Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protects ‘effects’ as well as people from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures.” United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 7l6 (l983) (Brennan, J.\nconcurring). It thus “protects two different interests of the citizen—the interest in retaining\npossession of property and the interest in maintaining personal privacy.” /d. (cleaned up). “A\nseizure threatens the former, a search the later.” /d. Like a search, a seizure is “per se\nunreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> unless it is accomplished pursuant to\na judicial warrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized.”\nId. at 7ol; see Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U.S. l, 3 (l98o).\n\nHere, the grand jury subpoena was unconstitutionally overbroad because it sought\nproduction of J entire file and was therefore akin to a general warrant. Moreover,\nthere is no dispute the government did not establish probable cause to believe that J\nHE file contained evidence of a crim. (EDT TZ 7 7 7__\nOO S—CSCSCSCSCis\nHE) Nor is there a dispute that the government lacked a warrant. (i\nSCs\nRe) Since the government had neither\nprobable cause nor a warrant, the J must be suppressed because the subpoena to yy\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 22\nHE «Was in fact a Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> search. And even if the government’s conduct did not\namount to a search, it constituted a seizure, which likewise should have been supported by\nprobable cause and warrant.\n\nA. The subpoena violated the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> because it was\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\nThe subpoena to J was unconstitutionally overbroad, and this Court should\nsuppress all evidence produced in response.\n\n“TA Jn order for the production of books and papers may constitute an unreasonable\nsearch and seizure within the 4th <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.” Hale, 2ol U.S. at 76. Because the Fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> was drafted with a particular eye to the abuse of general warrants, id. at 7l, a\nsubpoena that is “unreasonably overbroad” effects an unreasonable search under the Fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-l5-o29, 828 F.3d lo83, lo88 (9th Cir. 2ol6). An\noverbroad subpoena is “equally indefensible as a search warrant would be if couched in similar\nterms.” /d. (quoting Hale, 2ol U.S. at 77). A subpoena is overbroad when the government fails\nto make a “reasonable effort to request only those documents that are relevant and non-\nprivileged, consistent with the extent of its knouledge about the mater under investigation.” Jd.\n\nHere, the government by its oun admission made no effort—must less a reasonable\neffort—to tailor and target the subpoena to [MM As the prosecutor said to yy\na.\n\nee\n\nee\n\nee\nee\nee\nee\ni —“CSsSCisCCteSS\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 22\nSee Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex.

The government’s representations to J were, of course, false.\nThe government met with JJ before it issued the subpoena, it knew what was in\nSEES fic and who was ond it\nnevertheless disclaimed any ability to narrouly tailor any subpoena. Given “its knouledge about\nthe mater under investigation,” the government’s failure to make any effort, much less a\n“reasonable effort,” to request “only those documents that are relevant and non-privileged,”\nrenders the subpoena overbroad and unconstitutional. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-l5-\no29, 828 F.3d at lo88.\n\nSo overbroad was the subpoena that [J actually produced to the government\ni —SSSCSCs\nOO —SCSCSCSCSCies\ni —SSCSCSCies\ni —CSSCSC‘Cies\nOO —SSCSCs\n\nIt is obvious why the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires suppression /d. at lo89. This type of\noverbroad subpoena is exactly what the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is designed to prohibit: searches that\ninvade “the privacies of life” from “arbitrary” pouer and “police surveillance” that is “too\npermeating.” See Carpenter, l38 S. Ct. at 22l3 (quoting Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 74o\n(l979)). Otherwise, “when the government seeks all material of a broad generic type that a party\npossesses—every piece of paper in a corporation’s files, for example, or, as in this case,” every\npiece of paper in a J file, “a reasonable possibility that some of that material would be\nrelevant would suffice to validate the subpoena, no mater hou vast its sweep, and no mater the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2557\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 22\ndegree to which the subpoena would reach private material of no pertinence to the grand jury’s\ninquiry.” See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-l5-o29, 828 F.3d at lo89. The Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\ndoes not allou such a sweeping search, which would be nothing but a modern-day general\nwarrant. Jd. at lo88.' This Court should suppress all evidence the government obtained from the\nsubpoena to x\n\nB. The government’s subpoena to i was an unconstitutional\n\nwarrantless Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> search.\n\nApart from its overbreadth, the subpoena violated the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> because it\namounted to a warrantless search without probable cause.\n\nThe Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protects people, not places. Katz, 389 U.S. at 35l. Thus, “when\nan individual ‘seeks to preserve something as private,’ and [her] expectation of privacy is ‘one\nthat society is prepared to recognize as reasonable,’ . . . that official intrusion into that private\nsphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported by probable cause.”\nCarpenter, l38 S. Ct. at 22l3 (quoting Smith, 442 U.S. at 74o). This definition of a what\nconstitutes a “search” “seeks to secure ‘the privacies of life’ against ‘arbitrary pouer’” and “to\nplace obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance.” Jd. at 22l4 (quoting Boyd,\nll6 US. at 63o; United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 58l, 595 (l948)). A “grand jury is . . . ‘without\npouer to invade a legitimate privacy interest protected by the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.’” United\nStates v. Thomas, 736 F.3d 54, 6l (lst Cir. 2ol3) (quoting United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S.\n338, 346 (l974)).\n\n‘Tt is for this reason that this Court should grant Maxwell’s Motion for Discovery of every grand\njury subpoena. Without being able to examine the grand jury subpoenas, Maxwell cannot evaluate\nwhether other subpoenas issued by the grand jury in connection with this case are unconstitutionally\noverbroad, as the subpoena to Ts.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 22\nincluding Maxwell’s i, and not to share Confidential information with law\nenforcement. as:\n\nee\n\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\n\nCSC\nMotion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex.

For one thing, the Fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> was not at issue in Martindell, so the Court had no occasion to decide whether a warrant\nmight have been required. For another, Martindell does not speak to what shouing would have been\nrequired for the issuance of a subpoena, probable cause or something less. Even if a warrant weren’t\nrequired here, a shouing of probable cause was. See People v. Mason, 989 P.2d 757, 76o (Colo. l999)\n(noting jurisdictions that recognize an expectation of privacy in subpoenaed materials and that require a\nsubpoena duces tecum of such records to be supported by probable cause). Finally, of course, the\ngovernment didn’t comply with Martindell because it never gave Maxwell notice and an opportunity to\nquash the subpoena and to challenge the government’s misrepresentations through the adversary process.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo256o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 22\n\nNeither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a\nlegitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I. First, Maxwell did\nnot “voluntarily convey” x sucd her, not the other way around.\nMoreover, Maxwell declined to answer 3\nOO ——SSC‘CCes\nRen. None of this was voluntary.\n\nSecond, Maxwell’s expectation of privacy in her i is not limited in\nthe way Miller’s expectation of privacy was limited in his bank records. To the contrary, both\nMaxwell’s J were confidential under the Protective Order. And while the Protective\nOrder did not apply to evidence produced at trial, the case setled before trial, thereby confirming\nMaxwell’s legitimate expectation that the I would not be shared outside the\natorneys working in the case and, if necessary, the district court.\n\nThird, Maxwell reasonably understood that the yy would not\nbe shared with the government. Giuffre proposed a law enforcement exception to the Protective\nOrder’s confidentiality requirement, but Maxwell rejected the exception and the district court\nnever adopted it. Unlike in Smith and Miller, Maxwell did not “assume the risk” that her\nRe ould be divulged to the government.\n\nHad the government obtained the MY from Maxwell’s atorneys, there\nwould be no question that the government’s conduct would constitute a Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nsearch. “[C]lients of an atorney maintain a legitimate expectation of privacy in their client files.”\nDeMassa v.

Because she did not voluntarily offer her I, and\nbecause she reasonably believed JJ was and would remain private under the\nProtective Order, Maxwell had a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her\nEe oven though the government obtained them from a third party other than\nher atorneys.

All twelve depositions\nwere taken “pursuant to a court-approved stipulation to the effect that the depositions should be\ntreated as confidential and used solely by the parties for prosecution or defense of the action.” Jd.\nat 292. Without seeking to intervene, and without serving a subpoena or warrant, the government\ncalled and then wrote to the district court to request access to the deposition transcripts. /d. at\n293. The government claimed that the deposition transcripts were relevant to its investigation of\nperjury, subordination of perjury, and conspiracy related to the l97o presidential election in\nChile.

The government, “moreover, feared that unless it could obtain the deposition\ntranscripts, it would be unable to secure statements from the witnesses because they would claim\ntheir Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights in any investigative interviews.” /d. The district court denied the\ngovernment’s request, “holding that the deposition testimony had been given in reliance upon the\nprotective order, thus rendering unnecessary invocation by the witnesses of their Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights, that the requested turnover would raise constitutional issues, and that\nprinciples of fairness mandated enforcement of the protective order.” /d.

The proper procedure, as the government should knou, was either\n\nto subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a\n\ngrand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to\n\nquash or modify the subpoena, see Rule l7(c), or to seek permissive intervention\n\nin the private action pursuant to Rule 24(b), for the purpose of obtaining vacation\n\nor modification of the protective order.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 22\nId. at 294. Either avenue, explained the Court, would provide the real party in interest notice of\nthe government’s request and an opportunity to be heard, either by moving to quash the\nsubpoena or opposing intervention and modification of the protective order. /d.\n\nThe Court also rejected the government’s argument that the district court was too\nsolicitous of the witnesses’ Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. /d. at 295. According to the Government,\nthe witnesses were under no compulsion to testify, and having given testimony, they voluntarily\nwaived any Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right they may have had. /d. But as the Second Circuit explained,\nthe government’s argument ignored the reality of civil litigation:\n\nUnless a valid Rule 26(c) protective order is to be fully and fairly enforceable,\n\nwitnesses relying upon such orders will be inhibited from giving essential\n\ntestimony in civil litigation, thus undermining a procedural system that has been\nsuccessfully developed over the years for disposition of civil differences.

The Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against\nself-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 25\nthat Minor Victim-l would engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of\nNew York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Id. § l9.\nARGUMENT\n\n“Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,” a non-capital criminal offense must be\n\ncharged “within five years next after such offense shall have been commited.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3282(a); see l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (l994) (same). Because Counts One through Four charge Ms.\nMaxwell with offenses that were completed no later than l997, and because the indictment was\nnot returned until July 2o2o, these counts are time-barred unless “otherwise expressly provided\nby law.” Id.\n\nFor two independent reasons, § 3283, on which the government relies (see Government’s\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (““Gov. Mem.”), Dkt. No. 4, (filed Jul. 2, 2o2o), at 5),\ndoes not save Counts One through Four. First, under the version of § 3283 that was in effect at\nthe time of the alleged offenses, the limitations period expired when the accuser reached the age\nof 25, which indisputably occurred many years ago here. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While\nCongress amended the statute in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period to “during the life of the\nchild,” see Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of\n2oo3 (PROTECT Act) (the “2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>”), PL lo8-2l, April 3o, 2oo3, § 2o2, ll7 Stat.\n65o, 66o, that <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> cannot apply to conduct that occurred during the l99os. Second, by\nits plain terms, § 3283 applies only to offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. But the sexual or physical abuse or kidnaping of a\nchild is not an element of any of the offenses charged here. Accordingly, § 3283—regardless of\nwhich version is considered—simply does not apply.\n\nI. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Does Not Apply Retroactively.\nAt the time of the alleged offenses, § 3283 provided as follous:\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2657\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 25\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall\n\npreclude such prosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). Thus, if an individual commited an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse of a l6-year-old person on June l, l994, and the victim reached age l7 on July l,\nl994, then the statute of limitations as to that offense would have expired on July l, 2oo2, when\nthe victim reached age 25—-such that an indictment in 2o2o would be time-barred. There is no\ndispute that all three of the accusers here turned 25 long ago, and thus the statute of limitations in\neffect at the time of the offenses has expired.\n\nIn 2oo3, houever, Congress amended the statute and extended the time in which a\nprosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim. See 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> at 66o.7 l8\nU.S.C. § 3283, as amended in 2oo3, provided as follous:\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of\n\nl8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the government would apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> retroactively\nto offenses Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited years earlier, nothing in the text suggests\nthat the statute may be applied retroactively.\n\nTo the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed a strong “presumption against\nretroactive legislation” that is “deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prod.,\n5ll USS. 244, 265 (l994) (emphasis added). “[T]he principle that the legal effect of conduct\nshould ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has\ntimeless and universal appeal.” /d. (internal quotation omited). “Retroactivity is not favored in\n° The statute was amended again in 2oo6 to its current version, which further modifies the limitations period to the\nlife of the victim or lo years after the offense, whichever is longer. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Because all three of the\nalleged victims identified in Counts One through Four are alive, the 2oo6 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> does not affect the analysis\nhere. Moreover, the government relies on the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Gov.

Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail to include an express\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2659\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 25\nretroactivity provision in the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>; it actually considered and rejected such a\nprovision, signaling its clear intent that the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> not be retroactive. Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision.

United States, 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7), the only Second\nCircuit case that analyzes the retroactivity of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, is inconsistent with this\nanalysis. In Weingarten, the court’s analysis was in the context of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim. Thus, Weingarten offers litle more than a distraction from the analysis required\nhere: The court was not required to and did not decide the merits of the issue, noting that “[t]he\nunderlying merits question remains for another day, another case.” Jd. at 58. Moreover, the\ndefendant in Weingarten did not raise, and the court did not consider, the argument that Congress\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2662\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 25\nhad expressly prescribed that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> would not be retroactive; Weingarten\nconsidered only whether there was an express prescription that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> would be\nretroactive, concluding that the defendant’s counsel could have made “colorable” arguments that\nthere was no such prescription. Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8), which the government cites in support of its contention that the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> may be applied retroactively. Gov. Mem. at 6.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2663\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 25\n\nIn the civil context, the Second Circuit has acknouledged a distinction between\nretroactively applying an extended limitations period to revive a stale claim, which has been held\nimpermissible under Landgraf, and retroactively extending the limitations period for a live claim,\nwhich has been held permissible. See, e.g., Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(collecting and comparing civil cases). The criminal context, houever, is fundamentally\ndifferent.\n\nAta minimum, Toussie “potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach” in\ncriminal cases. United States v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 645 (lst Cir. 2ol8) (evaluating 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claim). “In other words, when\nCongress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from applying an enlarged\ncriminal statute of limitations retrospectively.” Jd. As shoun in the first step of Landgraf, the\ntrumpet sounded by Congress in enacting the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> was anything but uncertain:\ncongressional intent is clear.\n\nIn the criminal context, the retroactive application of an extended statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim is not merely an impermissible effect under Landgraf; it violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3).* As Landgraf itself\nrecognized, houever, the principle against retroactivity is not simply an application of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; rather, it is a “deeply rooted” presumption based on “[e]lementary\nconsiderations” of fundamental “fairness.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 265-66. See also Thom v.\nAshcroft, 369 F.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., writing for the majority but noting\nhe was speaking for himself) (stating that anti-retroactivity presumption in Landgraf is “triggered\n+ For this reason, the government would be barred from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell for any offense against the third\naccuser (identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-3) even if the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> otherwise applied, because\nthe third accuser reached age 25 in a. and thus the statute of limitations as to her had expired by the time\nof the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 25\nIl. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l6\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years” could be brought\nuntil the victim reached age 25. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged\n\nConspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause\none or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of\nthe conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp. 2d 299,\n3ll (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2), aff'd sub nom. United States v.

Documents Related to Ms. Maxwell’s Motions\n\nAlong with this motion, Ms. Maxwell has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for\nbreach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein and two motions to\nsuppress the evidence obtained from the government’s subpoena of ae. These\nmotions request, as alternative relief, that the Court grant discovery and an evidentiary hearing\non the issues bearing on the motions. Ms. Maxwell asked the government for documents\nrelevant to these motions, but was denied. To the extent that the Court grants discovery related\nto these two motions, Ms. Maxwell requests, among other things, the documents requested in\nExhibit E, which were previously requested from the government. (See Ex. E).\n\nMs. Maxwell also requests the Court to order the government to produce a copy of the\nsubpoena that it issued to a. As set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s motion to suppress,\nMaxwell was not aware that the subpoena had been issued and never had the opportunity to\ncontest it.

Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments.

First, the Government’s brief in\nopposition to the Defendant’s pre-trial motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions.

The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material.

Schulte initially proceeded to trial in February\n2o2o. The jury returned a guilty verdict on two counts, but failed to reach a unanimous verdict\non the national security charges. The Defendant moved for a mistrial with respect to those |\ncounts, which the Court granted.\n\nShortly after the first trial ended, New York City emerged as the global epicenter of the :\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. As a result, the majority of in-person proceedings throughout the\nSouthern District of New York were suspended. Grand juries and jury trials were no exception. |\nNevertheless, on June 8, 2o2o, the Government obtained a third superseding indictment (the ,\n“Indictment”) in anticipation of a second trial. |\n\nSchulte nou moves to dismiss the Indictment on the grounds that the grand jury venire |\nthat returned the Indictment did not reflect a fair cross-section of the community, in violation of\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and the Jury Selection and Service Act of l968 (“JSSA”), 28\nU.S.C. § l86l et seq.

The Indictment charges Schulte with nine criminal\ncounts relating to his alleged transmission of national defense information to WikiLeaks. (ECF |\n4o5.)

Relatedly, Schulte argues that\nthe Government’s decision to seek the Indictment from White Plains was improperly made.\nIll. The District’s Jury Plan\nTo understand Schulte’s claims, it is necessary to orient ourselves to some background\nknouledge of the District’s jury selection process. Under the JSSA, each federal district court\nmust “devise and place in operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit\njurors.” 28 U.S.C, § l863(a). The District’s jury selection plan (“Jury Plan”), which has been in\nexistence since 2oo9, provides the blueprint for the random selection of grand and petit jurors\nthroughout the District. See Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (hereinafter “Jury\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002826.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRrEiehd Fieebda22e/P l Pafagecd 26 2o\n“jurors are needed in each courthouse, names are drawn from each qualified wheei and\nsummonses are sent to those individuals.” Jd.\nAPPLICABLE LAW\nI.

To :\nestablish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove |\neach of the follouing elements: |\n(l) That the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community; |\n(2) That the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not |\nfair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and :\n(3) That this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-\nselection process.\nDuren v.

Castaneda v.

Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 659 (2d Cir. l996).\nIl. The JSSA |\nFinally, the JSSA sets forth the Nation’s policy that: “all litigants in Federal court\nentitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair\ncross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.” 28 U.S.C. |\n§ l86l.

See United States v. LaChance,\n788 F.2d 856, 864 (2d Cir. l986).

(cleaned up). |\nANALYSIS\nl. Fair Cross-Section Challenge |\nBecause Schulte’s fair cross-section claim arises under both the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and\nthe ISSA, he must meet the three-part test set forth under Duren. See LaChance, 788 F.2d at |\nThe parties do not dispute that the first element under Duren has been satisfied. That |\nelement asks whether “the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.”\nDuren, 439 U.S. at 364. Here, Schulte alleges that African American and Hispanic American |\njurors were unlawfully excluded from the jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 7.) These groups have\nbeen recognized as “distinctive” by the Second Circuit. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (“Rioux has\nsatisfied the first prong of the Duren test: Blacks and Hispanics are unquestionably “distinctive”\ngroups for the purposes of a fair-cross-section analysis.”); United States v. Barnes, 52o F.\nSupp.2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7). Schulte has therefore satisfied the first element under\nDuren. The Court holds, houever, that Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements of\nthe Duren test. Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge must be rejected.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002833.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafade b? 26 2o\noccur.

United States, 245 U.S. 48o (l9l8).\nIt should come as no surprise then that a defendant may be indicted in one courthouse and tried\nin another, as long as the prosecution stays within the jurisdiction of the relevant district.® See |\nAndrades, 5o7 F.

United States v. |\nFernandez, 48o F.2d 726, 73o (2d Cir. l973) (“[S]ince the theft of which Fernandez was\nconvicted occurred in Queens, in the Eastern District of New York, trial in Westbury, in Nassau |\nCounty, a county adjacent to Queens and within the District, rather than in Brooklyn, the |\nheadquarters of the Eastern District, does not offend the terms of these venue requirements.”). |\nSecond, the prevalence of this practice as well as the compelling justification for it in this |\ncase add further support for its propriety. As the Government points out, “it is common for cases |\nto be indicted by grand juries siting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhatan\ncourthouse.” (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 4 (collecting cases).) And here, that practice was especially 2\njustified in light of the COVID-l9 pandemic, which had all but brought grand juries and other in-\nperson proceedings to a grinding halt during the summer of 2o2o. See supra 2-3. Thus, in |\nconsidering this compelling justification, the Court is unpersuaded by Schulte’s allegations that }\n6 Because this case concerns the grand jury phase of criminal proceedings, the principles\nespoused in past precedents endorsing a flexible view of trial venue requirements Ought to apply 2\na fortiori in the grand jury context.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002835.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafade bf BO 2o\n*8 (“The absolute disparity method, on the other hand, appears to be the preferred method for :\nanalyzing jury underrepresentation under the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in the Second Circuit.”). The\nCourt will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method. |\nThe absolute disparity method measures the difference between the groups’ !\nrepresentation in the relevant community and their representation in the jury venire. See Rioux, :\n97 F.3d at 655—56. For example, if African Americans compose lo% of the community but only\n5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id. Under Second Circuit precedents, |\nabsolute disparities nearly as high as 5% have not been found to satisfy the underrepresentation\nelement under Duren. See United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677-78 (2d Cir. l99o) (holding |\nabsolute disparities of 3.6% and 4.7% were insufficient to satisfy Duren’s second element); see :\nalso Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658 (l.58% and 2.l4% were insufficient); Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *8 |\n(3.69% and 3.64% were insufficient); Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d at 5l5 (2.8% and 2.3% were\ninsufficient).\nThe Court holds that the absolute disparities here fall comfortably within the outer limits :\nprovided by these past decisions. The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up )\nll.2o% and Hispanic Americans make up l2.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t\nOpp. Br. at 2o.) In the relevant community, African Americans make up l2.45% and Hispanic\nAmericans l4.l2% of the jury eligible population. (Schulte Reply at 6-7, Gov’t Opp. Br. at l8.)\nAccordingly, the absolute disparities are l.25% for African Americans (l2.45% - ll.2o%) and\nl.l5% for Hispanic Americans (l4.l2% - l2.97%). Because those figures fall comfortably\nwithin the tolerated disparities in past precedents, the Court concludes that Schulte has not met\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002837.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafads 66 26 2o\nproceeded this way was because of an external force: the COVID-l9 pandemic and its |\nsubstantial curtailment of in-person proceedings throughout the District. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658.\nThis allegation therefore does not establish systematic exclusion. !\nSecond, Schulte argues that the Jury Plan’s replenishment of the master wheels only once |\nevery four years constitutes systematic exclusion. (Schulte Br. at l4.) According to Schulte, the\nfour-year period causes addresses to grou “stale” as people move to new residences, and because\nAfrican Americans and Hispanic Americans are, on average, younger and thus more likely to :\nmove, he argues that these groups are systematically excluded. (See id. l4-l5.) But even\ngranting the dubious premises that make up this deductive reasoning, the Court remains ,\nunpersuaded because, again, the true cause of the exclusion—younger people moving more |\noften—is an external force, not a systematic defect inherent in the Jury Plan. Rioux, 97 F.3d at )\n658 (concluding that a jury system that led to undeliverable questionnaires did not constitute ,\nsystematic exclusion}. At botom, the Court cannot charge the District’s Jury Plan with a Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> violation because of hou often people move residences throughout the District.\nThird, Schulte asserts that the Jury Plan’s exclusive reliance on voter registration lists\nconstitutes systematic exclusion. This claim, houever, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in Schanbarger. See 77 F.3d at l424 (“{A] jury venire drawn from voter registration\nlists violates neither the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>'s fair cross-section requirement nor the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s guarantee of Equal protection.”).\nFinally, Schulte alleges that the exclusion of “inactive voters” in certain counties within\nWhite Plains constitutes systematic exclusion because African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans are more likely to be inactive voters. (Schulte Br. at l5.) But again, the cause of the\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002838.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOnouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafad¢? bf 26 2o\nalleged exclusion here (e.g. people moving) is an external force.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658. |\nAccordingly, this argument must be rejected under Rioux.\" See id. |\nIn sum, Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements under Duren.\nAccordingly, his fair cross-section challenge under the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and J SSA must be\nrejected. |\ni. Equal Protection Challenge :\nSchulte next contends that the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors violates the Equal Protection clause under the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. (Schulte Br. at | |\nl6-l7.) As noted above, the Equal Protection clause forbids the exclusion of racial minorities\nfrom grand and petit juries. Castaneda, 43o U.S. at 492. But to establish a prima facie violation\nof equal protection, Schulte must furnish “proof of discriminatory intent.” United States v.\nBiaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o). Because Schulte cannot make such a shouing, his 2\nEqual Protection challenge fails. His only contention on this element is that the\nunderrepresentation of African Americans and Hispanic Americans “cannot be the result of\n° Under New York law, voters are designated “inactive” when a “County Board received\ninformation indicating that a voter may no longer be living at her address of registration.”\n\n- Common Cause/New York v. Brehm, 432 F. Supp.3d 285, 29o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (examining New\nYork voting law). |\nlo The Court is unpersuaded by Schulte’s remaining allegations of systematic exclusion, which\nare that (l) jurors drawn from the overlapping counties were inequitably prorated between the :\ntwo courthouses, and (2) a technical glitch in the White Plains master wheel excluded jurors who )\nhad provided an alternative address when registering to vote. As to the former claim, Schulte has\nnot shoun that this alleged error caused the underrepresentation at issue. See Allen, 2o2l WL |\n43l458, at *ll (finding same error to have had “minimal” effect on venires). And as to the later |\nclaim, the parties concede that this glitch actually augmented, not diminished, African American\nand Hispanic American representation in the White Plains master wheel. (Gov't Opp. Br. at l7.)\n\nAccordingly, these allegations do not satisfy the third prong under Duren.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002839.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads £8 26 2o\n\nchance.” (Schulte Br. at l7.) But the Court will not assume or infer that this District has been\noperating under an intentionally discriminatory Jury Plan since 2oo9. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 659 :\n(rejecting Equal Protection challenge due to lack of evidence shouing intentional\ndiscrimination). Therefore, the Defendant’s Equal Protection claim must be rejected.\nTH. JSSA\nSchulte’s remaining claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on these claims, he must |\ndemonstrate a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions. LaChance, 788 F.2d\nat 87o, “Mere technical violations of the procedures prescribed by the Act do not constitute :\nsubstantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. (cleaned up). The criteria for\ndifferentiating between a substantial and technical error turns on the “nature and extent of its |\neffects[.]” Id. The Court holds that Schulte cannot demonstrate a substantial failure to comply |\nwith the JSSA and that his statutory claims must therefore be rejected.” :\nAs an initial mater, Schulte repleads his Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> fair cross-section challenge\n\nunder the ISSA.

But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above. See supra ‘7-l7. |\nApart from his fair cross-section challenge, Schulte also contends that the follouing :\ndefects constitute substantial violations of the JSSA: (l) the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains and not Manhatan; (2) the exclusion of inactive voters from :\ncertain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the allegedly erroneous proration of jurors ,\n'l To be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic exclusion\nprong of the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> analysis.

July 3o, 2o2o), ECF No. lo-l (explaining the Defendant’s “concerns that\n[Ms. Giuffre] and [BSF] were acting as either express or de facto agents of the government” and\nfalsely accusing BSF of leaking a confidential deposition transcript to the Government). The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena. The Defendant’s motion to authorize\nservice of the Subpoena on BSF should be denied.!\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas\nin criminal proceedings. Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\n: A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”).

Nor has she\npointed to anything in the extensive record of either the OPR investigation or the civil litigation\nsurrounding the NPA that would suggest that the NPA applies to this District, or to the crimes in\nthe Indictment, or to Maxwell. In the absence of any such evidence—and in the face of substantial\ncontrary evidence gathered in the civil litigation and OPR investigation—the Court has no\nobligation to conduct a hearing.\n\nFor similar reasons, the defendant’s motion for discovery should be denied. To the extent\nthe defendant seeks discovery under Rule l6, she has failed to meet her burden. A defendant\nseeking discovery under Rule l6 “must make a prima facie shouing of materiality and must offer\nmore than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.” United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 26l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citations omited). Here, the defendant has\noffered nothing more than her conjecture that some unspecified evidence might exist. The motion\nshould be denied.\n\nI. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nCounts One through Four are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse...\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and each of the victims identified in the\nIndictment remains alive. Maxwell contends that Section 3283 should not be applied to conduct\nthat predated its <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> in 2oo3 (Def. Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the\nstatute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other\ncircuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break\nnew ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 239\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever\nis longer.”).\n\nFinally, later that same year, Congress enacted a new statute as part of the Adam Walsh\nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2oo6, Pub. L. No. lo9-248, l2o Stat. 587. That statute\neliminated the statute of limitations entirely for certain crimes involving the sexual exploitation of\nminors. /d. tit. I], § 2ll(l), l2o Stat. at 6l6 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3299).\n\nB. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to Section 3283 Applies Retroactively\n\nCounts One through Four of the Indictment charge crimes that occurred between l994\nand l997. At the time of the offense conduct, the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 (l994), ran until “the child reaches the age of 25.” Houever, in 2oo3, while the statute of\nlimitations had not yet run for the crimes charged in the Indictment,!? Congress amended the\nstatute, extending the limitations period to permit a prosecution at any time “during the life of the\nchild.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). Because the victims are all alive, the Indictment is timely under\nthe 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\nPut simply, the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> applies to any conduct that could have been charged at\nthe time of its enactment. The legislative purpose behind Section 3283 and a plain reading of the\nstatute compel this conclusion, and courts have repeatedly held that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> applies\nretroactively, provided that the statute of limitations had not run for the offense at the time of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. See, e.g., United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend, rather than shorten, the statute of limitations\napplicable to sexual abuse crimes, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the\nprosecution was timely.”) (citing United States v.

June 7, 2olo) (holding that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of Section 3283 applies to pre-\nenactment conduct, and rejecting the argument “that the lack of a savings clause in the 2oo3\nversion of section 3283 is fatal to extending the statute of limitations.”); United State v.

USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244 (l994), the Supreme Court set forth a\ntwo-part framework for determining whether a statute applies retroactively. At step one of the\nanalysis, “if Congress ‘expressly prescribed’ that a statute applies retroactively to antecedent\nconduct, ‘the inquiry ends[] and the court enforces the statute as it is writen,’ save for\nconstitutional concerns.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55 (quoting Jn re Enter. Mort. Acceptance\nCo. Sec. Litig. (“Enterprise”), 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o5-o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4)). Houever, “when a statute\n‘is ambiguous or contains no express command’ regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must\ndetermine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would create presumptively\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 239\nimpermissible retroactive effects.” /d. For the reasons set forth belou, the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 satisfies both steps of Landgraf, and should be applied to pre-enactment conduct.\n\nl. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Satisfies Step One of Landgraf\n\nAt step one of the Landgraf analysis, the question is whether Congress has “expressly\nprescribed the statute’s proper reach.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. When evaluating Congress’s\nintent at step one of the Landgraf inquiry, the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o6-o8. In this case, the amended\nversions of Section 3283 evince Congress’s express intent to extend the statute of limitations. The\ntext and history of Section 3283 firmly establish that, with each <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the statute of\nlimitations, Congress intended to repeal and replace the prior version of the statute and thereby\nextend the time to bring live charges of child sexual abuse.\n\nThe 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, like the l994 version of the statute, specifically states that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution of such offense during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3).\nClaims that were live in 2oo3 were, at the time, subject to the then-existing statute of limitations,\nwhich ran until the victims reached the age of 25. Whenever that statute of limitations ran, it would\n“otherwise preclude prosecution.” Instead, that statute of limitations was replaced by the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\nThe Eighth and Ninth Circuits have both held that Congress intended to extend the statute\nof limitations for live claims of sexual abuse. In United States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682 (8™ Cir.\n2oo5), the Eighth Circuit reasoned that “both the title and wording of § 35o9(k) indicate that\nCongress intended by it to extend the general statute of limitations. . . . § 35o9(k) was later\nrecodified at § 3283 and continued to extend the statute of limitations in child abuse cases.” Jd. at\n684 (citing United States v. Johns, l5 F.3d 74o, 743 (8th Cir. l994) (holding that an earlier version\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 239\nof § 35o9(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in l99o)). The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

No such intent is manifest in either the text or in Senator Leahy’s statement.\n\nThe reach of Section 3283 is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the statute\nof limitations to pre-enactment conduct, the Court should resolve its analysis at Landgraf step one\nand apply the statute as Congress intended. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—at worst—\nambiguous. Ifthe Court takes that view, it should proceed to Landgraf step two.\n\n2s The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Satisfies Step Two of Landgraf\n\nIf the Court were to determine that the legislative intent behind Section 3283 is ambiguous,\nthe inquiry then extends to the second step of the Landgraf analysis, which examines the\nretroactive effects of the statute. As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, “[a] statute does\nnot operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating\nthe statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations based in prior law.” 5ll U.S. at 269. Instead, the\nquestion is whether the statute “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\nparty’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already\ncompleted.” Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995)\n(quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o). Applying Section 3283 here would have none of those\neffects. Maxwell’s rights, liabilities, and duties were governed by the substantive criminal statutes\ngoverning her conduct. Until the statute of limitations expired, Maxwell had the same legal\nliability, the same rights, and the same incentives to retain evidence. A statute extending that\nperiod ataches no new legal consequences; rather, it preserves the status quo. Therefore, the\nstatute does not operate “retrospectively” within the meaning of Landgraf. See Cruz v. Maypa,\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 239\n\nmuch violence is done to our instinctive feelings of justice and fair\n\nplay. For the state to assure a man that he has become safe from its\n\npursuit, and thereafter to withdraw its assurance, seems to most of\n\nus unfair and dishonest. But, while the chase is on, it does not shock\n\nus to have it extended beyond the time first set, or, if it does, the\n\nstake forgives it.\nFalter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o, 425-26 (2d Cir. l928). The distinction between statutes that\nrevive expired prosecutions and those that extend existing limitations periods has deep roots in\nestablished jurisprudence. It is well-setled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that revive\ntime-barred prosecutions, but permits laws that retroactively extend limitations periods. Stogner\nv. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632 (2oo3) (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not “prevent\nthe State from extending time limits for . . . prosecutions not yet time barred.”); United States v.\nMorgan, ll3 F.3d l23o, l997 WL 2687l2, at *7 (2d Cir. l997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-\nstanding rule in this circuit is that Congress has the pouer to extend the period of limitations\nwithout running afoul of the ex post facto clause, provided the original period has not already\nrun.”’) (citing Falter, 23 F.3d at 425-26). And other circuits have emphasized this distinction in\nthe context of Section 3283. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 685.\n\nRead together, the Second Circuit’s decisions in Weingarten, Vernon, Enterprise, and\nFalter establish that Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions. That is precisely what has occurred here, because the charges in the Indictment were\nstill timely when the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> extended the limitations period. As a result, applying\nSection 3283 in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, step two of\nLandgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 applies retroactively.\n\nResisting this conclusion, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal context, Landgraf’s\nsecond step provides protections beyond the Ex Post Facto Clause. But that is not the law. See\nNader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63o (rejecting the argument that “there is ‘daylight’ between the Ex Post\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 239\ncourt resolved the issue by answering a common sense question: “Does someone who merely\npossesses child pornography sexually abuse the child portrayed in the images?” /d. at 8l7. This\ninquiry has no relevance here, as this case does not involve the possession of child pornography.\n\nThe crimes charged in the Indictment plainly involved the sexual abuse of minors. First,\nthe Indictment clearly alleges that the minor victims were subjected to actual, physical sexual\ncontact as part of the defendant’s crimes. See Indictment at {{ 4 (alleging that conduct touard\nminor victims involved sexual abuse), 5 (alleging that “Epstein’s resulting abuse of minor victims\nincluded, among other things, touching a victim’s breast, touching a victim’s genitals, placing a\nsex toy such as a vibrator on a victim’s genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he\nmasturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein’s genitals.”), 7 (describing paterns of sexual\nabuse). Moreover, the Indictment alleges that the defendant persuaded, induced, enticed, and\ntransported minors for purposes of engaging in criminal sexual activity, and that she conspired to\ndo the same. As discussed above, the offenses charged in the Indictment accordingly involved the\nsexual abuse of minors as defined in Section 35o9(a) and incorporated into Section 3283.\n\nBecause the defendant’s crimes involved sexual abuse, the expanded statute of limitations\nset forth in Section 3283 applies to the crimes charged in Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment and her motion should be denied.\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Alleged Improper Pre-\n\nTrial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Indictment should be dismissed because the Government’s\ndelay in bringing the charges violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. (Def. Mot.\n7). The defendant has not and cannot successfully establish such a violation. First, the defendant\nhas not established that any alleged pre-indictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense.\nHer speculative assertions about lost witnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3oo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 239\nUnited States v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988). The defendant has not made such\na shouing. Her speculative assertions simply do not rise to that level.\n\nThe defendant first claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-\nindictment delay due to the unavailability of Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the\nalleged agent of Minor Victim-l), and Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarey.\nShe contends that the loss of Epstein demonstrates actual prejudice because Epstein “would have”\ntestified that the defendant did not engage in the criminal activity with which she is charged. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 8). That assertion is speculative at best, and the law is clear that “proof of prejudice must\nbe definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6; see also Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657\n(finding that “perceived prejudice is speculative” where there was “no way of knouing what [the\nunavailable witness’s] testimony would have been”). To credit Maxwell’s argument is to assume\nthat Epstein, after being indicted with federal sex trafficking charges, would have taken the stand,\nwould not have invoked his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights, and would have provided testimony that\nexculpated Maxwell, which a jury would have credited in the face of contradictory trial evidence.\nThis is an exercise in chain upon chain of conjecture that comes nouhere close to meeting the\nburden of demonstrating actual prejudice. See Spears, l59 F.3d at lo85 (“[A] defendant must do\nmore than shou that a particular witness is unavailable and that the witness’ testimony would have\nhelped the defense. He must also shou that the witness would have testified, withstood cross-\nexamination, and that the jury would have found the witness credible.” (citations omited)); see\nalso United States v. Valona, 834 F.2d l334, l339 (7th Cir. l987) (noting that prejudice analysis\nmust consider whether the missing witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” whether\nthe jury would have found him a “credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when compared\nto other trial evidence “would affect the trial outcome” (internal quotation marks and citations\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003020.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 239\nmanufactured any alleged delay to gain a tactical advantage over her. She has “offered no credible\nevidence to suggest that the Government tarried in bringing charges against [her] solely to gain\nsome prosecutorial advantage.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5. As such, because the\ndefendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of shouing both actual prejudice and unjustifiable\nGovernment conduct, her motion to dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay should be\ndenied.”\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). (Def. Mots. 3 & ll). In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a protective order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination. Although the defendant styles her request for relief as two separate\n°5 The defendant asks the Court for leave to supplement her motion “after the government provides\nher with meaningful discovery” and notes that “after the disclosure of meaningful discovery, [she]\nmay request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not\nbeen dismissed on other grounds.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\ninvitation to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS),\n2olo WL 289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July l3, 2olo) (“The motion to dismiss the Indictment as the\nresult of pre-indictment delay is therefore denied, without prejudice to appropriately supported\nlater motion practice.”); United States v. Drago, No. l8 Cr. o394 (SJF) (AYS), 2ol9 WL 3o72288,\nat *2 (E.D.N.Y. July l5, 2ol9) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay\nwithout prejudice to renewal).\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 239\nmotions, the suppression motions overlap in fact and argument, and accordingly, the Government\nresponds to both motions in this section.\n\nAs set forth herein, the defendant’s suppression motions challenging a judicially approved\ngrand jury subpoena should be denied without a hearing for multiple reasons. As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003031.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 239\nof the materials in light of the “extraordinary protections” of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedue\n6(e). Ud. at l7-l8).\n\nFinally, Chief Judge McMahon also inquired whether the materials sought by the\nGovernment might be used to commence criminal proceedings against either of the parties to the\nlibel case, i.e., including Maxwell. (/d. at l8). The Government acknouledged that possibility as\na general mater. (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon noted that the parties to the protective order relied\non that order “in order to give whatever in discovery they gave, whether it was deposition\ntestimony they gave or — then again, I can’t fathom why anybody who has any criminal exposure\nwould not have taken the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in response to questions in a civil deposition, but I\ndon’t knou.” (/d. at l8-l9). The Government stated, “I do not knou, but I think it is entirely\npossible that what we are seeking is page after page of people taking the Fifth. That is entirely\npossible. But to the extent that it is not or there are other materials -- and this may be bad for our\nargument, but in all transparency and candor, I think there may be other individuals who also relied\non the protective order.” (/d.). The Government further explained that it “want[ed] to have a\nformal application” for the relevant materials and took that approach to “avoid the types of\nproblems” created by other less formal government requests in other cited cases. (/d. at 2o).\n\nb. April 9, 2ol9 Hearing\n\nChief Judge McMahon held another conference on April 9, 2ol9. She stated that she\nwanted “to make sure I’m not in a Chemical Bank kind of situation, so I would like to knou about\ncontacts between [the USAO-SDNY and Boies Schiller] prior to the issuance of the subpoena on\nthe subject of your investigation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added)).*4 In Chemical\n4 Tellingly, Maxwell omits the italicized portion of this question from her motion, thereby\nstripping important context from the nature of Chief Judge McMahon’s question which, as asked,\nwas focused on “your investigation.” (See Def. Mot. 3 at 7).\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 239\ncommited perjury.” According to two anonymous sources, “a second meeting occurred.”\nHouever, the Article cites another anonymous source as “insist[ing] [a second meeting] never\nhappened.”\n\nB. The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the protective order to permit compliance with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s application under Martindell, properly exercised her discretion\nin modifying the protective order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) protective order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 239\nDe Maxwell’s Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Claim Fails\n\nMaxwell’s Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> motion is premised on a wholly unsupported expansion of\nthe law. Because Maxwell lacked a privacy interest in the files of a third party law firm who\nrepresented her adversary in civil litigation, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful, she\ncannot make out a Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> violation. Moreover, even if Maxwell had standing to assert\nthis claim, it would nonetheless fail because the Government relied in good faith on a judicial order\npermiting compliance with its subpoena.\n\na. Maxwell Has Not Established Standing\ni. Applicable Law\n\nThe Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protects the “right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const. amend IV.\n“The basic purpose of this <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> . . . is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals\nagainst arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” Carpenter v. United States, l38 S. Ct.\n22o6, 22l3 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). “It has been clear for a generation that\n‘Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights are personal rights . . . [that] may not be vicariously asserted.’” United\nStates v. Haqq, 278 F.3d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (quoting Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. l28, l33-34\n(l978)). Accordingly, a defendant’s Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights “are violated only when the\nchallenged conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy rather than that of a third party.”\nUnited States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 73l (l98o) (emphasis in original); see also United States\nv. Villegas, 899 F.2d l324, l333 (2d Cir. l99o). Ultimately, the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> inquiry is\n“whether [a] defendant has established a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched.”\nUnited States v. Chuang, 897 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir. l99o) (citations omited). This threshold\nquestion involves two separate inquiries: (l) whether a defendant has demonstrated a subjective\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 239\nexpectation of privacy in the places and items that were searched; and (2) whether that expectation\nwas one that society accepts as reasonable. /d. It is axiomatic that “[t]he proponent of a motion\nto suppress has the burden of establishing that his oun Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights were violated by\nthe challenged search or seizure.” Kakas, 439 U.S. at l3o, n.l; see also Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448\nU.S. 98, lo4 (l98o).\n\nUnder the third party doctrine, the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> “does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by [the third party] to Government authorities.”\nUnited States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (l976). The Supreme Court has long held that “a person\nhas no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (l979), “even if the information is revealed on the\nassumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose,” Miller, 425 U.S. 435, at 443.\nExceptions to the applicability of the third party doctrine are narrou. For example, in Carpenter,\nl38 S. Ct. at 222o, the Supreme Court declined to extend the third party doctrine to cell site\nlocation information, holding that “a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a\nlegitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.” l38 S. Ct. at 2222. Houever, the\nCourt stressed that its holding was “a narrou one,” with specific consideration given to “the unique\nnature of cell phone location information,” id. at 222o, which “provides an intimate windou into\na person’s life,” id. at 22l7.\n\n“The law is clear that the burden on the defendant to establish [Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>]\nstanding is met only by sworn evidence, in the form of affidavit or testimony, from the defendant\nor someone with personal knouledge.” United States v. Montoya-Eschevarria, 892 F. Supp. lo4,\nlo6 (S.D.N.Y. l995) (citations omited); see also United States v. Ulbricht, No. l4 Cr. 68 (KBF),\n2ol4 WL 5o9oo39, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s exception to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d l37, l43 (2d Cir.\n2ol8) (quoting Davis v.

Sept. 26, 2ol8) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited). ““‘[T]he exclusionary rule is not an individual right and\napplies only where it results in appreciable deterrence.” United States v.

Asa result, exclusion should be a “last\nresort” rather than a “first impulse.” United States v. Rosa, 626 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited). The exclusionary rule should be used only where law\nenforcement “‘exhibit[s] deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights.”” United States v. Raymonda, 78o F.3d lo5, ll7-l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (quoting\nUnited States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 443 (2d Cir. 2ol3)); see also United States v.

Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (l984). Asa result, although the burden\nis on the Government to establish good faith, “[s]earches pursuant to a warrant will rarely require\nany deep inquiry into reasonableness, for a warrant issued by a magistrate normally suffices to\n\n87\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 239\nestablish that a law enforcement officer has acted in good faith in conducting the search.” J/d.\n(internal quotation marks and citations omited); see also Golino v.

Indeed, the good faith exception does\nnot apply only in four narrou circumstances:\n\n(l) where the issuing magistrate has been knouingly misled; (2)\nwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial\nrole; (3) where the application is so lacking in indicia of probable\ncause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the\nwarrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nUnited States v. Moore, 968 F.2d 2l6, 222 (2d Cir. l992) (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 923). The good\nfaith exception analysis applies in the context of court orders. See, e.g., Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at\nl43 (applying good faith analysis in Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> challenge to cell phone location\ninformation obtained by subpoena issued pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 27o3(c)(2)); United States v.\nSerrano, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol4 WL 2696569, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.

This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 239\n3. The Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained Pursuant to\nthe Subpoena Under the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Is Without Merit\n\nThe defendant’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to the subpoena on Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> grounds fails for multiple, independent reasons. As an initial mater, Boies Schiller\nis not the Government and was not acting as an agent of the Government when it deposed the\ndefendant or otherwise litigated the civil case against her. That the defendant may regret her choice\nto respond to Boies Schiller’s questions during two depositions instead of invoking her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination does not transform that choice into a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> violation.\n\na. Applicable Law\ni. The Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> — Generally\n\nThe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> provides in pertinent part: “No person . . . shall be compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. To establish a Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> violation, an individual must “demonstrate the existence of three elements:\nl) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication, and 3) the incriminating nature of that\ncommunication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d ll66, ll68 (l987); see also, e.g., In Re\nThree Grand Jury Subpoenas Jan. 5, l988, 847 F.2d lo24, lo28 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nIt is “axiomatic that the <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not automatically preclude self-incrimination,\nwhether spontaneous or in response to questions put by government officials.” United States v.\nWashington, 43l U.S. l8l, l86 (l977). “Indeed, far from being prohibited by the Constitution,\nadmissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable.” Jd. at l87. “[T]he\nFifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> proscribes only self-incrimination obtained by a ‘genuine compulsion of\ntestimony.’” /d. (quoting Michigan v. Tucker, 4l7 U.S. 433, 44o (l974)); see also Washington,\n43l U.S. at l87 (“Absent some officially coerced self-accusation, the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege\nis not violated by even the most damning admissions.”). Nor does the Constitution “prohibit every\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 239\nelement which influences a criminal suspect to make incriminating admissions.” /d. The question\nis not whether a witness was encouraged to speak, but whether his “free will,” when he spoke,\n“was overborne.” /d. at l88; see also, e.g., United States v. Corbet, 75o F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir.\n2ol4).\n\nIt follous that the Government need not inform a witness of the nature of its investigation,\nsee United States v. Okwumabua, 828 F.2d 95o, 953 (2d Cir. l987), much less his individual status\nin the investigation, see Washington, 43l U.S. at l89 & l9o n.6. The Constitution does not\n“require that the police supply a suspect with a flou of information to help him calibrate his self-\ninterest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights.” Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564,\n576-77 (l987) (internal quotation marks omited); see also, e.g., id. at 577 (there is no requirement\nthat law enforcement give information that might affect “the wisdom” of speaking). Nor does the\nConstitution require that someone be questioned only in the manner most likely to ensure that he\ngives the decision whether to speak careful thought. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 66o F.3d\nl49, l57 (2d Cir. 2oll) (‘the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not protect against hard choices” (internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Mullens, 536 F.2d 997, looo (2d Cir. l976) (there is a\ndifference between “those choices which are physically or psychologically coerced and those\nwhich are merely difficult’).\n\nIn short, the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is only violated by “government misconduct” that is\n“coercive.” Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. l57, l63 (l986); see also Oregon v. Elstad, 47o U.S.\n298, 3l2 (l985) (Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> prohibits “coercion” effected “by physical violence or other\ndeliberate means calculated to break the suspect’s will’).\n\nil. The Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> — Act of Production Privilege\n\nThe act of production privilege is a form of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege pertaining to\n\nthe production of materials. “[A]n individual may claim an act of production privilege to decline\n97\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003059.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l25 of 239\nto produce documents, the contents of which are not privileged, where the act of production is,\nitself, (l) compelled, (2) testimonial, and (3) incriminating.” Jn re Three Grand Jury Subpoenas\nDuces Tecum Dated Jan. 29, l999, l9l F.3d l73, l78 (2d Cir. l999).\n\nConsistent with these requirements, the privilege only “prohibits the compelled disclosure\nof documents when the act of production has independent communicative aspects—such as an\nadmission that the documents exist, that the subject possesses or controls the documents, that the\ndocuments are authentic, or that the subject believes the documents are responsive to the\nsubpoena.” Jn re Various Grand Jury Subpoenas, 924 F. Supp. 2d 549, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3),\naff'd, 579 F. App’x 37 (2d Cir. 2ol4); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 39l, 4o8 (l976).\nIt follous that the privilege does not apply when “[t]he existence and location of the [sought]\npapers are a foregone conclusion and the [compelled individual] adds litle or nothing to the sum\ntotal of the Government’s information by conceding that he in fact has the papers.” Jd. at 4ll; see\nalso In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir. l993);\nMadanes v. Madanes, l86 F.R.D. 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (“[E]ven if documents contain\nincriminating information, requiring a person to produce them does not implicate the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> unless the act of production is itself testimonial in nature and incriminating to the\nperson making the disclosure.”).\n\nil. The Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> — When Private Action Is Deemed\nGovernment Action\n\nAs discussed above, “[t]he sole concern of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> . . . is governmental\ncoercion.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at l7o. “[T]he Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege is not concerned ‘with\nmoral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official\ncoercion.’” Jd. (quoting E/stad, 47o U.S. at 3o5). For this reason, even “[t]he most outrageous\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003060.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 239\nbehavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that\nevidence inadmissible.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at l66.\n\nThis does not mean that only action undertaken directly by the Government may violate\nthe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> (or another right). In certain circumstances, a private entity may be deemed\nto be acting as a government agent. See United States v. Stein, 54l F.3d l3o, l46 (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(“Actions of a private entity are atributable to the State if there is a sufficiently close nexus\nbetween the State and the challenged action of the entity so that the action of the later may be\nfairly treated as that of the State itself.” (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nHouever, this standard “‘is not satisfied when the state merely approves of or acquiesces in\nthe initiatives of the private entity, or when an entity is merely subject to governmental regulation.”\nId. (internal quotations marks and citations omited; alterations incorporated)). Nor is it sufficient\nthat a non-government entity chooses to cooperate with a government investigation or has its oun\nparallel investigation. See id. at l5o. Non-government action is atributable to the government\n“only when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the\n[defendant] complains.” Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 99l, loo4 (l982) (emphasis in original).\n“Such responsibility is normally found when the State ‘has exercised coercive pouer or has\nprovided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be\ndeemed to be that of the State.’” Stein, 54l F.3d at l47 (quoting Blum, 457 US. at loo4); see also\nFlagg v. Yonkers Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 396 F.3d l78, l87 (2d Cir. 2oo5).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> claim fails because she has not\ndemonstrated state action. Boies Schiller is not an agent of the Government and has not been at\nany time during the course of the Government’s investigation, including when it initiated the civil\n\n99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 239\nlawsuit against the defendant or took her deposition years before the Government initiated its oun\ninvestigation. The defendant offers no evidence to the contrary, and there is no reason to believe,\non this record, that the Government in any way controlled Boies Schiller when it litigated a civil\ncase against the defendant. As such, the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not apply.\n\nThe defendant’s claim further fails because without coercion or compulsion, there is no\nFifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> violation. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 42o, 43l (l984) (rejecting claim\nthat a “failure to inform [the defendant] of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege barred use of his\nconfession at trial”); United States v. Mitchell, 966 F.2d 92, loo (2d Cir. l992) (“Inculpatory\nstatements are not involuntary when they result from a desire to cooperate, or from a defendant’s\nignorance of, or inatention to, his right to remain silent.”); United States v. Mast, 735 F.2d 745,\n75o (2d Cir. l984) (same). The defendant implicitly argues that she only testified under oath in\nthe civil mater because she thought she would not be held to that oath. In other words, had she\nknoun that she would be subject to the penalties of perjury, she would have invoked her Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right. But the defendant’s misguided expectation that she would face no\nconsequences cannot be said to coerce speech. The defendant, represented by able counsel,\nvoluntarily chose to waive her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights and testify under oath. And she chose to\ndo so in connection with civil depositions that occurred over two years before the Government\nopened its investigation. The circumstances surrounding that decision come nouhere near the type\nof coercion that rises to the level of a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> violation. See, e.g., United States v. Ash,\n464 F. Supp. 3d 62l, 627-3o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (finding suppression of defendant’s phone\nunwarranted where defendant complied with former employer’s request to return the phone\nbecause defendant was not coerced into doing so, and rejecting defendant’s argument that the\n\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003062.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 239\nemployer was required to warn her that it might produce the phone to the government, even\nassuming arguendo that that employer’s actions were atributable to the government).\n\nThe defendant’s claim that her act of production privilege was somehou violated similarly\nfails. Counsel cites Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6 (l886) for the proposition that “a\ncompulsory production of the private books and papers . . . [also] is compelling . . . him to be a\nwitness against himself, within the meaning of the fifth <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.” (Det. Mot. ll at l5) (quoting\nBoyd, ll6 U.S. at 634-35). In Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, the\nSecond Circuit ruled that the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not protect the contents of private papers that\nare not business documents, and also noted that “[s]Jeveral aspects of the Boyd decision did not\nendure.” l F.3d at 9o (citing Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 39l (l976)).\n\nFurther, the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not protect against being compelled to speak and then\nspeaking falsely. “[E]ven if an individual’s perjured testimony is improperly procured because of\ngovernment misconduct, that testimony may still be used to prosecute that defendant for perjury.”\nUnited States v. Olivieri, 74o F. Supp. 2d 423, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing United States v.\nRemington, 2o8 F.2d 567 (2d Cir. l953); United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d 2o4 (2d Cir. l965));\nsee also United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l8o (l977) (“[P]erjury is not a permissible way of\nobjecting to the Government’s questions. . . . Indeed, even if the Government could, on pain of\ncriminal sanctions, compel an answer to its incriminating questions, a citizen is not at liberty to\nanswer falsely.”); Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72, 9o (l969) (rejecting challenge to false\nstatement prosecution; “[I]t cannot be thought that as a general principle of our law a citizen has a\nprivilege to answer fraudulently a question that the Government should not have asked. ...

Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\ntranscript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), l998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary\ncircumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\nconcluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003065.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 239\nmisconduct that would justify the extraordinary remedy the defendant seeks—the motion must be\ndenied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause\n“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot\nunfairly and without meaningful process deprive a person of life, liberty, or property,” while\nsubstantive due process “prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the\nconscience, or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Jd. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited; alteration omited).\n\nProcedural due process analysis focuses on whether “government action depriving a person\nof life, liberty, or property. . . [is] implemented in a fair manner,” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 746 (l987). “Courts examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first\nasks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the\n[Government]; the second examines whether the procedures atendant upon that deprivation were\nconstitutionally sufficient.” United States v. Arzberger, 592 F. Supp. 2d 59o, 599 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo8)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omited).\n\nAs to substantive due process, the Supreme Court is “always . . . reluctant to expand the\nconcept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this\nunchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 52l U.S. 7o2, 72o\n(l997) (internal quotation marks and citation omited). Because of this reluctance, the Supreme\nCourt held in Graham vy. Connor, 49o U.S. 386 (l989), “that where a particular <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of\n\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 239\ngovernment behavior, that <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, not the more generalized notion of substantive due\nprocess, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.” County of Sacramento v.

Oliver, 5lo U.S. 266, 272 (l993)\n(“[t]he protections of substantive due process have for the most part been accorded to maters\nrelating to marriage, family, procreation, and the right to bodily integrity.”).\n\nThe defendant bears the “‘very heavy’ burden of establishing a due process violation.”\nUnited States v. Walters, 9lo F.3d ll, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol8). “To succeed on a claim that the\ngovernment’s conduct in pursuit of evidence violates a defendant’s Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> due process\nrights, the government’s method of acquiring the evidence must be so egregious that it ‘shocks the\nconscience.”” United States v. Loera, 333 F. Supp. 3d l72, l84 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited). “The concept of fairness embodied in the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> due process guarantee is violated by government action that is fundamentally unfair\nor shocking to our traditional sense of justice, or conduct that is ‘so outrageous’ that common\nnotions of fairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a\nconviction against the accused.” United States v. Schmidt, lo5 F.3d 82, 9l (2d Cir. l997) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited). “Such outrageous or conscience shocking behavior\ninvolves egregious invasions of individual rights, or coercion.” United States v. Coke, No. o7 Cr.\n97l (RPP), 2oll WL 3738969, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2oll) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omited). The Second Circuit has explained:\n\nThe paradigm examples of conscience-shocking conduct are\negregious invasions of individual rights. See, e.g., Rochin, 342 U.S.\nat l72, 72 S. Ct. 2o5 (breaking into suspect’s bedroom, forcibly\natempting to pull capsules from his throat, and pumping his\nstomach without his consent). Especially in view of the courts’\nwell-established deference to the Government’s choice of\ninvestigatory methods, see United States v. Myers, 692 F.2d 823,\n843 (2d Cir. l982), the burden of establishing outrageous\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]he Supreme Court has recognized three purposes for the supervisory pouers, ‘to\nimplement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring\nthat a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy\n\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 239\ndesigned to deter illegal conduct.’” Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (quoting United States v.\nHastings, 46l U.S. 499, 5o5 (l983)). “Houever, while there are times when a district court may\nproperly find it absolutely necessary[, in order] to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice\nsystem, to suppress evidence under its inherent or supervisory authority, ‘the Supreme Court has\nexplained that a court’s inherent pouer to refuse to receive material evidence is a pouer that must\nbe sparingly exercised [only in cases of] manifestly improper conduct by federal officials.” United\nStates v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (alterations and emphasis in original) (internal\nquotations and citations omited). The Second Circuit has “‘recognized that courts cannot fashion\ntheir oun sub-constitutional limitations on the conduct of law enforcement agents.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 792 (2d Cir. l996)); see also United States v. Myers, 692\nF.2d 823, 847 (2d Cir. l982). “Accordingly, the court should not exercise its inherent or\nsupervisory pouer ‘as a substitute for Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> jurisprudence, which adequately\nsafeguards against unlawful searches and seizures.’” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol (quoting Ming He,\n94 F.3d at 792); see also United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 737 (l98o) (“the supervisory\npouer does not extend so far” as to “confer on the judiciary discretionary pouer to disregard the\nconsidered limitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”).\n\nb. Discussion\nBy asking the Court to exercise its inherent authority, the defendant apparently means to\nsuggest that the Court should grant the relief she seeks, even if she has failed to establish a violation\nof the Constitution or other governing law. The defendant fails to provide justification for the\nextraordinary remedy of suppression or to cite persuasive case law in favor of such an\nextraordinary use of the Court’s inherent authority.\nllo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 239\n\nThe law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority does not extend to suppressing\nevidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.\nat 737 (holding that “the supervisory pouer does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered\nlimitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976\n(2d Cir. 2ol4) (same); United States v. Jennings, 96o F.2d l488, l49l (9th Cir. l992) (“Absent a\nviolation of a recognized right under the Constitution, a statute, or a procedural rule, a district court\nis not entitled to exclude evidence as a sanction against government practices disapproved of by\nthe court.”). The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that principle, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 4ol-o2 (“We can\nappreciate the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact\nthe integrity of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an\nadversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing\nevidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise\nits supervisory pouers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot\nbe described as a recognized right.” (internal citations omited)).\n\n6. The Defendant Is Not Entitled to a Hearing\n\nThe defendant argues that if the Court is “disinclined” to grant the extraordinary relief of\n\nsuppression she seeks, she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to probe the Government’s\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel72 of 239\nin each indictment—to his personal profit); United States v. Broun, No. o7-o296, 2oo8 WL\nl6ll46, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Jan. l6, 2oo8) (severing an “isolated” firearms possession charge on a\ncertain day from other narcotics and firearms charges); United States v. Martinez, No. 92 Cr. 839\n(SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l9, l993) (similar).\n\nThe defendant also contends that her false statements were not connected to the substantive\noffenses because they were made in a civil deposition, rather than “to the grand jury or the FBI to\nderail its investigation.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial mater, and as evidenced by the\ndefendant’s oun motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,\nthe defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal\ninvestigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the\ndistinction is of litle moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law enforcement exception to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l (citing United States v. Carson,\n464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. l972); Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9) (affirming denial of a severance\nmotion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the\nperjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to\nthat analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the seting in which the statement\nis made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (false statement\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 239\n\na conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, to entice minors to travel with the intent to commit\nan illegal sex act, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). See Indictment 4 l5-l7. In other words,\nCount One and Count Three charge the defendant with agreeing to commit two separate and\ndistinct federal crimes.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant does have a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury\nconvicts on more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple\npunishments for the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only\none of the multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already\nbeen entered on multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but\none count. /d.\n\nThe Second Circuit has clarified that District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss\na charge on multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing. See id. (vacating district court’s\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 239\n\nFinally, the defendant requests early disclosure of Rule 4o4(b) material that the\nGovernment may seek to introduce at trial. (Def. Mot. lo at l7). As is customary in this district,\nthe Government will provide notice to the defense of its intent to use any such evidence at least 45\ndays in advance of trial, which will leave sufficient time for the defense may file any motions in\nlimine to be considered at the final pretrial conference. See Thompson, 2ol3 WL 6246489 at *9\n(“The Government has represented that it will disclose the substance of [the 4o4(b) evidence it\nintends to introduce at trial] . . . in a timely fashion in order to permit the defendants the opportunity\nto challenge admission and to permit the Court to make an appropriate finding. This is all that Rule\n4o4(b) requires.” (alterations in original) (internal citation omited)); United States v. Tranquillo,\n6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the\nrequired disclosure two weeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b));\nUnited States v. Fennell, 496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good\nfaith noted its obligations under Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the\n4o4(b) evidence it intends to introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore\nno need to issue the order Defendant seeks.”). Accordingly, this motion should be denied.\nXI. =‘ The Use of a Grand Jury Siting in White Plains Was Entirely Proper\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, amidst a global pandemic that suspended grand juries across the country,\nthe Government sought and obtained an indictment from a grand jury of the Southern District of\nNew York (the “Southern District” or “SDNY”) siting in White Plains. The defendant nou\nchallenges the pool from which that grand jury was drawn, alleging that it does not reflect a “fair-\ncross section of the community,” and moves to dismiss the Indictment under the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. (Def. Mot. 9 at l). As set forth belou, the defendant’s arguments rely on faulty\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 239\npremises, and at any rate fail to meet the elements of a claim under the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\nTherefore, the defendant’s motion must be denied.\n\nA. Background\n\nl. The SDNY and Local Rules for the Division of Business\n\nThe defendant’s brief repeatedly uses the term “Division” to describe a “White Plains\nDivision” and a “Manhatan Division.” (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at 2 (“On June 29, 2o2o, the\ngovernment filed a sealed indictment of Ms. Maxwell in the Manhatan Division of this Court. The\ngovernment has conceded that Ms. Maxwell’s indictment was obtained using a grand jury seated\nin White Plains, apparently with jurors drawn exclusively from the White Plains Division.”)). Her\nuse of the term “division” is imprecise and atributes legal significance where there is none.\nUnderstanding hou that is so requires some background.\n\nDistrict courts in each state in the United States are prescribed by statute. United States\ndistrict courts in New York State are divided between four districts: Northern, Southern, Eastern\nand Western. 28 U.S.C. § ll2. While certain districts in other states are further divided into\n“divisions” by statute, see, e.g., id. § 8l (dividing Alabama into three “districts” and multiple\n“divisions” within each district), the federal districts in New York State are not so divided. That\nis, in the Southern District, no “divisions” have been created by statute. /d. § ll2(b). The statute\nprovides only that “Court for the Southern District shall be held at New York, White Plains, and\nin the Middletoun-Wallkill area of Orange County or such nearby location as may be deemed\nappropriate.” Id.\n\nIn the Southern District, the only authority determining whether particular cases are heard\nin the Manhatan or White Plains courthouse is the SDNY Business Division Rules. These rules\nbegin with an important preface: they “shall not be deemed to vest any rights in litigants... .”\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 239\ndepartments, and public officers in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the State or\nFederal Government who are actively engaged in the performance of official duties. /d. at Art. V;\n28 U.S.C. § l863(b)(6). Finally, because jury service for certain groups of individuals would\n“entail undue hardship or extreme inconvenience,” those individuals are excused or deferred upon\nindividual request. SDNY Jury Plan at Art. VI. These groups include:\n\n(l) Persons over 7o years of age;\n\n(2) Persons having legal custody and active daily care of a child under the age of l2, or\n\nwho are essential to the daily care of aged or infirm persons;\n\n(3) Persons who have satisfactorily served as grand or petit jurors in a State or Federal\n\ncourt within the last four years;\n\n(4) Volunteer safety personnel; and\n\n(5) Persons as to whom a judge finds, for any other reason, that jury service would\n\nconstitute an undue hardship and extreme inconvenience.\nTd.\n\nThe names of individuals who are determined to be qualified to serve as jurors, and are not\n“exempt, excused, or deferred,” comprise the Qualified Jury Wheels—one for service at the\nManhatan courthouse and one for service at the White Plains courthouse. /d., Art. lV.A-B. When\njurors are needed, names are drawn randomly from the Qualified Jury Wheels, and summonses are\nsent to those whose names are drawn. /d., Art. lV.C. After being summoned, these individuals\nare randomly assigned to jury panels as needed, for individual trials and grand juries at the\ncourthouse corresponding to the Qualified Wheel from which they were drawn. Id.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“The Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantees a criminal defendant a jury selected from a fair cross\nsection of the community.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 654 (2d Cir. l996). In Duren v.\nMissouri, the Supreme Court articulated a three part test that defendants must meet in order to\n\nl97\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 239\navailable grand jury that day, due to the global pandemic®*—“was a deviation from the established\npractice of indicting defendants in the division where the offense is alleged to have occurred and\nwhere the case will be tried.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 2). Because the offense is alleged to have occurred\nin the “Manhatan Division” and the defendant assumes that her jury trial will occur there too, she\nargues that the “appropriate comparison,” for the purpose of her fair cross-section claim, “‘is\ntherefore between the Manhatan Division and the qualified wheel for White Plains.” (Def. Mot.\n9 at 6). This premise is faulty.\n\n“Tt is well-setled that neither the jury selection statute nor the Constitution requires that\njurors be drawn from an entire district.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (collecting cases); see also United\nStates v. Plaza-Andrades, 5o7 F. App’x 22, 26 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“[O]Jur precedent makes clear that\nthe Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not entitle a defendant to be tried in a geographic location any more\n68 This case was indicted on June 29, 2o2o, on which date the grand jury siting in White Plains\nwas the only available grand jury in the District. Beginning on or about June 25, 2o2o, grand jury\nquorums returned in Manhatan, but with substantially less availability than before the pandemic.\nAs a result, the Government has sought indictments from grand juries siting in White Plains and\nManhatan, as availability permits. In this instance, the Government was prepared to indict on\nJune 29, 2o2o, and the only grand jury available in this District on that day sat in White Plains.\nThe global pandemic’s effect on grand jury availability continues to evolve, but at no point have\ngrand juries in White Plains or Manhatan resumed normal activity.\n\nThe defendant speculates that the Government sought an indictment on June 29, 2o2o\nbecause of some arbitrary desire to arrest the defendant on July 2, 2o2o, one year to the day after\na grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging Jeffrey Epstein with federal crimes on July 2,\n2ol9. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at l, 8). Seting aside the silliness of marking the anniversary of an\nindictment’s return, as opposed to the anniversary of the arrest itself, which took place on July 6,\n2ol9, there is no reality in the defense’s conspiracy theories. As the defense knous full well, the\nGovernment atempted to locate and arrest the defendant on July l, 2o2o but was unable to confirm\nher location until obtaining cellphone location data identifying her location and enabling her arrest\non July 2, 2o2o. The defense knous this because they have the warrant application that the\nGovernment submited on July l, 2o2o for the defendant’s cellphone location information, in\nwhich the Government stated that it had been unable to confirm the defendant’s location. In other\nwords, the Government indicted the defendant as soon as it was prepared to present the evidence\nit had gathered to a grand jury, and the Government arrested the defendant as soon as it was able\nto locate her after obtaining that indictment.\n\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 239\ncourthouse, were drawn from Nassau and Suffolk Counties. /d. at 24.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo333o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Enumerated Rights\nThe CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed\n\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”*®\nInitially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime\nvictims the follouing eight rights:\n\n(l) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.\n\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public\n\ncourt proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or\n\nof any release or escape of the accused.\n\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court\n\nproceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\n\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be\n\nmaterially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\n\nproceeding.\n\n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the\n\ndistrict court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole\n\nproceeding.\n\n(5) The reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\n\nGovernment in the case.\n263 See l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o).

Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed”’ On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”?*\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo343o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

As described belou, a court can and should\nmodify a protective order, or permit limited relief from it, to allou the recipient of a grand jury\nsubpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.\nThe Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v.

Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary. Consideration of such authority compels application of § 3283 by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue, and even under the definition of “sexual abuse” the\ngovernment proposes, none of the elements of either § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) constitutes sexual\nabuse.\n\nl, The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Does Not Apply Retroactively.\n\nThe government does not dispute that Landgraf is the appropriate framework for\ndetermining whether a statute applies retroactively.

Ifit has not, the court must determine\n“whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties\nwith respect to transactions already completed.” Jd.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3659\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page8of 22\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s opening memorandum (“Mem.”) has demonstrated, proper application\nof Landgraf prohibits retroactive application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Congressional intent\ncould not be clearer; Congress considered and expressly rejected a provision that would have\nmade the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> retroactive. That ends the Landgraf inquiry at step one. Even if the\ninquiry proceeds to step two, houever, the government has failed to adequately rebut Ms.\nMaxwell’s shouing that application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> here would have impermissible\nretroactive effects.\n\nA. Step One: Congress Did Not Expressly Prescribe Retroactivity and Rejected\n\na Proposal to Do So.\nl. Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision ends the\ninquiry at step one in Ms. Maxwell’s favor.\n\n“TW |here the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). As Ms.\nMaxwell’s opening memorandum demonstrated, congressional intent with respect to the\nretroactive application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is clear: the House version of the bill included\nan express retroactivity provision, the Senate version contained no retroactivity provision, and, in\nthe words of one of the bill’s co-sponsors, the House-Senate conference “agreed to drop\nlanguage from the original House-passed bill that would have extended the limitations period\nretroactively.” Senator Leahy, Amber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3). The Court\nneed look no further. Such an unambiguous expression of congressional intent establishes\nconclusively that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is not retroactive.\n\nThe government argues that Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision is not\nprobative, because according to Senator Leahy’s floor statement, the decision was grounded in\nconcerms about the revival of time-barred charges rather than the extension of live charges, and at\nleast some of the charges here were live at the time of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. But to the extent\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 22\n\nIt will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that\n\nretroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.\n\nThat consideration, houever, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against\n\nretroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursue a single goal, and\n\ncompromises necessary to their enactment may require adopting means\n\nother than those that would most effectively pursue the main goal.\n\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 285-86 (emphasis added). Thus, it is not anomalous at all that Congress\nwould “exempt[] all past offenders” from the new limitations period, as the government asserts\n(Opp. 3l); to the contrary, the law presumes that past conduct is exempt from legislation. Here,\nCongress’ clear intent that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> not be retroactive resolves the Landgraf inquiry\nin Ms. Maxwell’s favor at step one.\nDe Cases applying the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> retroactively are readily\ndistinguishable.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases that have applied the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nretroactively (Opp. 26-27), most of those cases analyzed the issue under the Ex Post Facto\nClause and gave litle, if any, consideration to congressional intent regarding retroactivity (as\nopposed to the intent of the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> itself). In all but one of those cases, no Landgraf\nanalysis was performed, and it does not appear that Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity\nprovision was considered or even raised.’ But the government does not dispute that Landgraf is\nthe appropriate framework—nor can it, given the Second Circuit’s acknouledgment that the\nretroactivity of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> must be analyzed under Landgraf. Weingarten v. United\nStates, 865 F.3d 48, 54-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\n* No Landgraf analysis was performed, nor was Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision discussed, in\nUnited States v.

Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9 (E.D. Va. 2ol9). In\nNader, the court performed a Landgraf analysis in analyzing the retroactivity of the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, and it appears to be the only previous case in which Congress’ explicit rejection of\na retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> has even been mentioned. In Nader, houever,\nthe court noted the legislative history of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> but held that only the ‘ext of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> was relevant to step one of Landgraf. 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627 (finding legislative\nhistory arguments “misplaced within the first step of the Landgraf analysis, which asks only\nwhether the statute at issue contains ... language unequivocally delineating the time period to\nwhich it applies”).\n\nNader’s exclusion of legislative history from the Landgraf analysis‘ cannot be reconciled\nwith the Supreme Court’s applications of Landgraf—or, for that mater, with Landgraf itself.\nSee, e.g., Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264 (considering legislative history); Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S.\n343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history” as part of first Landgraf step).\nAnd as the government acknouledges, “the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history” at the first Landgraf step. Opp. 28 (citing Jn re Enterprise\nMortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo4)). Thus, Nader is not persuasive\nauthority.\n\nIn short, no court has considered Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision\nin performing a Landgraf analysis of the retroactivity of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. In fact, the\ngovernment cites only three cases that have analyzed the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> under Landgraf at\nall: the Second Circuit and First Circuit opinions in Weingarten and United States v. Miller, 9ll\nF.3d 638 (lst Cir. 2ol8), respectively, which were ineffective assistance of counsel cases and\n* Although the court in Nader explicitly characterized legislative history arguments as “misplaced” within step one\nof Landgraf, it also omited them from step two of its Landgraf analysis. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627-32.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3663\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 22\nthus did not decide the issue (and in which Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nnot discussed), and Nader, in which the court incorrectly excluded legislative history from its\nLandgraf analysis. If Landgraf is correctly applied, and legislative history is given its proper\nweight in the analysis, it is clear from Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision that it did\nnot intend the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to be retroactive. Counts One through Four are therefore time-\nbarred.\n\n3. The government cannot prevail at step one.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s claim that it should prevail at step one can be easily\ndispensed with. The government relies on the language in the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the\ngovernment argues that this language refers to the pre-<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> version of § 3283, the Second\nCircuit recognized in Weingarten that “there is a more natural interpretation of that phrase that\ndoes not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2oo3 version of\n§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is\ndifferent from the default five-year limitations period under federal law.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d\nat 55. See also Miller, 9ll F.3d at 644 (suggesting that “otherwise preclude” language “may\nrefer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations”); Nader, 425 F.\nSupp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to “merely ‘signal the drafter’s intention that the\nprovisions .. . override conflicting provisions of any other section,’” rather than the pre-\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 22\nthe expanded statute of limitations for child sex abuse crimes. See Opp. Mem. 24 (quoting\nCrime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No. lol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified\nat l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l99o, “the only existing limitations period to which the\nlanguage could have referred was the [five-year] default limit set forth in [l8 U.S.C. § 3282].”\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 644. That is the logical reading of the same provision here.\n\nThe government cannot prevail on step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. Maxwell’s\nfavor, the inquiry must proceed to step two.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s Alleged\n\nOffenses Would Have Impermissible Effects.\n\nEven if the Landgraf inquiry were to proceed to the second step—whether retroactive\napplication would have impermissible effects—Ms. Maxwell should prevail. In arguing\notherwise, the government effectively claims that in the retroactivity context, Landgraf permits\nthe Court to ignore the bedrock principle that “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally\ninterpreted in favor of repose.’” TYoussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 5l8, 522 (l932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a civil case,\npurports to limit that principle, let alone abrogate it.\n\nThe government asserts that no court has held that retroactively extending a filing period\nfor live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf (Opp. 35),\nbut that is not so. In United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J. 2ol7), the court held\nthat it would be impermissible to retroactively extend a statute of limitations for live charges\n“absent clear legislative intent” to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Jd. at 655. In\ndoing so, the court read Landgraf in conjunction not only with Toussie but also with Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 52o U.S. 939 (l997), a post-Landgraf opinion in which the\nSupreme Court reiterated the law’s presumption against retroactivity and reiterated that “we\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 22\napply this time-honored presumption unless Congress has clearly manifested its intent to the\ncontrary.” Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 654 (quoting Hughes, 52o U.S. at 946 (emphasis added\nby court)).° The First Circuit, addressing the issue on an ineffective assistance of counsel of\nclaim (and thus not reaching a merits decision), issued a similar caution in the specific context of\nthe 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>:\n\n[W]hen Congress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from\n\napplying an enlarged criminal statute of limitations retrospectively. ... Seen in\n\nthis light, Toussie potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach.\n\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 645.°\n\nBy contrast, the government cites only one case—Nader—in which a court has held that\nthe application of a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct is permissible under\nthe second step of Landgraf. Like the government here, houever, the court in Nader offered no\npath to reconciling Landgraf with Toussie. Instead, it applied Landgraf, a civil case, in a manner\nthat interprets Toussie out of existence in the retroactivity context, without any suggestion from\nthe Supreme Court that it intended such an effect. The opinions in Miller and Gentile, in\nacknouledging the need to read Landgraf and Toussie in harmony, provide the correct legal\nframework for the application of the second step of Landgraf. This is particularly so in light of\nCongress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, a factor not\nconsidered in Miller and absent from Gentile.\n\nIn arguing that “Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions” (Opp. 34) (emphasis added), the government completely misses the point. There is\n° The government’s atempt to discredit Gentile on the ground that it relied in part on a pre-Landgraf opinion (Opp.\n36) rings hollou. The court made clear that it was applying Landgraf (in conjunction with Toussie and Hughes).\nGentile, 235 F. Supp. at 654-55.\n\n° For this reason, the Second Circuit’s applications of Landgraf in Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), and Jn re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo4)—both of\nwhich involved civil statutes of limitations—do not resolve the issue.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 34\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history, the Court follous Weingarten and\nconcludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse\nof a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus\nconcludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the\nPROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to\nher alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in\nWeingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the\nview Maxwell nou takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions\nof at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773\nF.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir.\n2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal\nstatute applies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994).\nCourts look first to the language of the statute. Ifthe statute states that it applies to past conduct,\ncourts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past\nconduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Jd.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To assess a statute’s meaning here, courts\nmust consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including\nthe statute’s history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter.\nMortg.

See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25 of 34\ncounsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the\nMann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party’s atorney\npresents serious risks to the fairness ofa trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73,\nl78 (2d Cir. 2oo9). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun credibility, jurors might\nperceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between\nargument and evidence might confuse the jury. /d. Disqualification of counsel also implicates\nMaxwell’s Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWF), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the atorneys who\nrepresented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with\nthe facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o—7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

The government points to the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to\nthat division to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of\nminorities.” Opp. 2ol (quoting Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24) (emphasis added by government). But the\ndefendant in Bahna was tried on Long Island before a jury “from the ‘Long Island Division’ jury\nwheel.” 68 F.3d at 23. He initially sought to have a jury “culled only from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond Counties” —l.e., from somewhere other than the place of trial. /d. at 26. Ms.\nMaxwell seeks precisely the opposite.\n\nThe government thus quotes the Second Circuit’s statement in Bahna out of context,\nbecause Bahna was based on the very premise lacking here: a jury “drawn from a properly\ndesignated division.” /d. at 24. Unlike the Long Island Division in Bahna, White Plains was not\n“properly designated” to indict Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhile the government claims that “it is common for cases to be indicted by grand juries\nsiting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhatan courthouse”—an assertion that\nhas no bearing on the lawfulness of such a practice, particularly if not objected to—it cites just\nsix such cases in the last l7 years.

The Government’s violation of the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires suppression.\n\nThe government does not defend the overbreadth of its subpoena, or even respond to\nMaxwell’s argument. Resp. at 82-95. The government also does not deny that the subpoena\neffected both a search and a seizure under the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. /d.\n\nInstead, the government argues that (l) Maxwell has no standing to challenge the\nsubpoena; (2) the government acted in good faith; and (3) the government inevitably would have\ncome to possess the 9o,ooo-sum pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.\n\nThe facts and law belie the government’s claims.\n\nA, Maxwell has standing.\n\nThe government’s standing argument boils doun to this: Maxwell cannot challenge the\nsearch because the material was in the possession of a third party and Maxwell lacked a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. Resp. at 84—86. This argument fails.\n\nAbundant authority holds that when confidential material is in the possession of a third-\nparty, a defendant has standing to challenge a grand jury subpoena of that material. Mater of\nGrand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Feb. l8, l988, 685 F.

(quoting Appeal of Hughes, 633 F.2d\n282, 288 (3d Cir. l98o)). See also US Bank Nat. Ass’n v. PHL Variable Ins. Co., No. l2 CIV.\n68ll CM JCF, 2ol2 WL 5395249, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2ol2) (“A party [has] standing to\nchallenge .. . a subpoena served on a non-party . . . [when] the moving party assert[s] some right\nor privilege personal to it, such as an interest in proprietary, confidential information that would\nbe disclosed or an interest in maintaining a privilege that would be breached by disclosure.”\n(citing cases)). In turn, in determining whether there is standing, “[c]ourts should consider\nwhether the information itself is private, confidential, privileged, or highly sensitive, and not the\nform the records take.” Refco Grp. Lid., LLC v. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., No. l3 CIV. l654 RA\nHBP, 2ol4 WL 542o225, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2ol4).\n\nIn United States v. Lavender, the Second Circuit held that while a defendant could not\nfile an interlocutory appeal of the district court’s denial of his motion to quash a third-party\nsubpoena, he was “free to raise his Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> claims via motions to suppress. . . .” 583\nF.2d 63o, 632 (2d Cir. l978). Since Maxwell never had notice of the subpoena to Boies Schiller,\nshe is doing here exactly what Lavender allous: filing a motion to suppress.\n\nTo be sure, if the government were right—that the mere fact of a third-party’s possession\nof property eliminates a defendant’s standing—then Carpenter v. United States would have\ncome out differently, since the defendant’s historical cell-site location information was in the\npossession of MetroPCS and Sprint. l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l2 (2ol8). But the United States\nSupreme Court rejected application of the third-party doctrine for two reasons, as this Court\nshould here.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo378l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 2o\n\nB. There is no good faith.\n\nThe rebutal to government’s good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith\nwhen the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search.\nAs the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon,\n\nSuppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing\n\na warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false\n\nor would have knoun was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.\n\n468 U.S. 897, 923 (l984).\n\nHere, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support\nthereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order\nand authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (reversing\ndistrict court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine, an exception to the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>'s exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 2o\nsuppression is proper under this Court’s inherent and supervisory authority. Mot. No. 3 & Reply\nin Support Thereof.\n\nIll. The Government’s violation of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires suppression.\n\nThe government offers three responses to Maxwell’s Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> argument. None\nis persuasive.\n\nThe government’s first response is to deny any state action. Resp. at 99-loo. But as even\nthe government admits, a private party, like Boies Schiller, is deemed to be an agent of the state\nwhen the government “has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that\nthe choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.” Resp. at 99 (quoting United States v.\nStein, 54l F.3d l3o, l46 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). Here, based on the record of the government’s contacts\nwith Boies Schiller in the months before and after Maxwell’s depositions, there is at least a\ngenuine question of fact as to the government’s role in encouraging Boies Schiller.\n\nWe knou that the government contemplated a perjury prosecution of Maxwell, as seen in\nthe government’s newly-disclosed notes from the meeting. Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. K, p\n5. And if the government is to be believed, there was only one meeting with Boies Schiller, two\nmonths before Maxwell’s first deposition. If the government was contemplating a perjury\nprosecution before Maxwell even testified, it stands to reason that Boies Schiller and the\ngovernment discussed at the February 29 meeting a plan to set a perjury trap for Maxwell.\n\nIndeed, the contemporaneous notes of the February 29 meeting shou that Boies Schiller\npromised to send the government “depositions,” Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. J, p 8, and\nDavid Boies later complained about his frustration that the government had not yet charged\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 2o\nMaxwell with perjury.* There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and\nBoies Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller’s conduct was in part at the government’s\nbehest.\n\nThe record in the Giuffre case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as\nwell. Based on Giuffre’s claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her\ndeposition, that Giuffre disclose any alleged “on-going criminal investigation by law\nenforcement” or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation.\nEx. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess “the\nimpact on any 5th <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege.” Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms.\nMaxwell the requested relief. Ex. B.\n\nThe day before Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition, houever, Judge Sweet ordered that\n“Tajny materials that [Giuffre] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over\n[by Giuffre] except for any statements made by [Giuffre] to law enforcement authority.” Ex. B, p\n2l. Maxwell had in fact served a discovery request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet\nGiuffre produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day.\n\nIn reliance on the Protective Order, which included no exception for any law enforcement\nneed or subpoena and based on Giuffre’s failure to disclose any “ongoing criminal\ninvestigation,” Maxwell did not assert her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against self-incrimination\nduring that deposition and testified truthfully.\n\nAs explained in Maxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the\ngovernment has nou disclosed several documents “with respect to any criminal investigations”\n\n> Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6, New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-story.html.\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo379o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 2o\nthat Giuffre possessed in February and March 2ol6. Under Judge Sweet’s pre-deposition order,\nGiuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2ol6 deposition.\nGiuffre’s failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet’s order, is compelling evidence\nthat Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> purposes when\ndeposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an\nevidentiary hearing is appropriate.\n\nThe government’s second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right.\nResp. at loo. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knouingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745\nF.3d l5, 23 (2d Cir. 2ol4). And “‘knouing’ means with full awareness of the nature of the right\nbeing abandoned and the consequences of abandoning it.” /d.\n\nHere, Maxwell did not knouingly waive her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right. She declined to\ninvoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the Protective Order, and on the\nunderstanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it\nturned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies\nSchiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material\nJudge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right\nand avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government fails in its atempt to distinguish United States v.\nOshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Resp. at lo2. The government says that the logic of\nOshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here,\nMaxwell was deposed “over two years before the Government opened its investigation.” Resp. at\nloo; id. at lo2 (noting that the defendant in Oshaiz “had already been indicted at the time of his\ndeposition in a civil case for almost seven months’’).

Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of any such\ninvestigation.\n\nPlaintiff also seems to be claiming that she is part of this alleged investigation and, as a\nconsequence, has inappropriately atempted to claim a non-existent “investigative privilege”\nwhich has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public interest privilege.” Issues related\nto Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce discovery, including her specious claims of privilege\nhave been raised and fully briefed.

This is, again, a meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to the information under the rules of discovery. And, the “need” for the information is\nboth obvious and necessary for at least three reasons: first, any communications between\nPlaintiff, her lawyers and law enforcement are likely inconsistent with statements Plaintiff has\nmade to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff's motive and bias in bringing this\nlitigation; and third, knouing the information will allou Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on\nany 5\" <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the\ninformation or accept a stay in the proceedings as a consequence of her failure to comply with\nher discovery obligations. She should not be alloued to brandish this, likely nonexistent, sword\nbut deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other\ndiscovery maters. Accordingly, in the event that the Plaintiff continues to fail to reveal the\ninformation that she claims to have regarding some “ongoing criminal investigation,” Ms.\nMaxwell moves to stay these proceedings.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003800.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- Qi BF AAR NVaD GUM ALASD , HHRedeie/ BEI29 | PA AadERE of 8\nApp.-ol36\n\nIn deciding to stay the civil case, courts generally weigh six factors: (l) the extent to\nwhich the issues in the criminal case overlap with those in the civil case; (2) the status of the\ncriminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the\ndelay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant; (5) the interest of the Court; and\n(6) the public interest.

First, presumably the issues in any purported criminal\ninvestigation are identical with the underlying issue in this case: did Ms. Maxwell assist in\n“trafficking” the Plaintiff as she claims from l999 to 2ool. As to the second factor Plaintiff\nclaims to have information about this issue, although no indictment has been issued. Third,\ngiven the age of the underlying allegations, almost 2o years, there does not appear to be any\nprejudice that could be caused by any delay. Fourth, in the event there actually is an\ninvestigation and Plaintiff is involved in fomenting the investigation, Ms. Maxwell has a\nsignificant interest in knouing about the investigation so that she can appropriately respond and\nassess any claim of privilege. Concerning factor five, the Court has an interest in controlling the\nproceedings before it and also has an interest in protecting the rights of the litigants.

Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 _ Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of6\nThe Hon.

Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7 Subpoena\nUnited States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s superficial analysis of a Fed. R. Crim. P. l7 subpoena is neither\naccurate nor informative. The collection of various cliche phrases about Rule l7 subpoenas,\nselectively gathered from cases inapplicable here, is unpersuasive, and the Court should deny\nthe requested relief because: (l) the government lacks standing to interfere with subpoenas\nissued to the third party respondents; and (2) this intrusion is yet another atempt to infringe\non Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, and due\nprocess, all in violation of the 5“ and 6\" Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn February 2ol6 (and likely at least one other time in the weeks and months that\nfolloued), lawyers representing numerous civil litigants, including then-Plaintiff Virginia\nGiuffre, met with the government to foment an indictment of Ms. Maxwell. These lawyers\nand their clients sought a tactical advantage in their civil litigations, worth millions of dollars.\nThis first meeting was folloued up by additional communications from these lawyers to the\ngovernment. Subsequently, and unknoun to Ms. Maxwell, the government brokered a deal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3853\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page4of8\nThe Hon.

The Government Lacks Standing\n\nA party lacks standing to challenge a subpoena issued to a third party absent a claim of\nprivilege or a proprietary interest in the subpoenaed mater. Langford v. Chrysler Motor\nCorp., 5l3 F.2d ll2l (2d Cir. l975). Accord United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL),\n2o2o WL 6939677, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (“[C]ourts in this District have generally\ncome to the conclusion that the Government can move to quash subpoenas issued for the\nrecords of non-parties only on the basis of the Government’s oun legitimate interests.”). See\nalso United States v. Cole, No. l9 CR. 869 (ER), 2o2l WL 9l2425, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. lo,\n2o2l) (noting “the majority rule in this District” that the government has standing to quash\na subpoena of a non-party only if the alleged victim has asked it to, or if the government can\nassert legitimate interests of its oun in quashing the subpoenas).\n\nThe government has failed to articulate any of its oun “legitimate interest” here. First,\nthe government speculates, without knouing, that the defense subpoenas implicate the\ngovernment’s “interest in preventing any undue lengthening of the trial, any undue harassment\nof the witness and his family, and any prejudicial over-emphasis on the witness’s credibility.”\nLeter, p. 4. In support of this speculation, the government cites United States v. Ray, supra.\nThe government does not acknouledge, houever, that in Ray the court denied it standing to\nmove to quash the subpoena.\n\nIn turn, other than quoting the cliche, the government has failed to articulate hou the\ndefense subpoenas would implicate this interest. Moreover, the defendant has no reason to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 227 Filed o4/2l/2l Page2of3\nPage 2\n\nin question include, among other things, depositions of potential witnesses.' If the defense were\nto put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose\npermissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the\ndefense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,\nincluding to cross-examine trial witnesses.\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the\nGovernment submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to\noffer these materials under certain circumstances. For example, it is well established that a\ncriminal defendant who testifies in her oun defense may be impeached with materials that would\notherwise be subject to suppression. United States v. Trzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo26 (2d Cir. l997)\n(“The Supreme Court has held that illegally acquired evidence may be used to impeach defendants\nwho testify in their oun defense.”) (citing Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 64-66 (l954)).\nAs the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusionary rule must be balanced with the truth-seeking\nfunctions of a trial:\n\nIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an\n\naffirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another\n\nto say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which\n\nevidence in the Government’s possession was obtained to his oun\n\nadvantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction\n\nof his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be\n\na perversion of the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\n' The Government further notes that many of the materials in the file in question are duplicates of\nmaterials the Government has obtained through other sources. For example, the file contains\nmaterials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law enforcement agencies. At\ntrial, the Government is likely to offer documents it has obtained during its investigation through\nother sources, even though those materials happen to be contained in duplicate in the file in\nquestion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 232 Filed o4/22/2l Page4of4\nPage 4\naccept Exhibit A to Reply Brief l and Exhibit A to Reply Brief lo under seal.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: ___s/\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe /\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By email)\nThe Court grants the Government’s proposed redaction and sealing requests.

International Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). If this\nCourt agrees with Ms. Maxwell’s arguments, not only will it suppress all 9o,ooo-some pages\nof material the government improperly obtained through its ex parte subpoena, it will also\nsuppress all evidence derived therefrom.

First, while the constitution in certain\ncircumstances allous the government to use unconstitutionally-obtained evidence for\nimpeachment purposes, e.g., Harris v. New York, 4ol U.S. 222, 223-24 (l97l) (statements\nsecured in violation of Miranda are admissible for impeachment purposes if voluntary), the\nconstitution forbids admission of evidence for all purposes if the government’s conduct\nviolated due process, e.g., New Jersey v.

The Court should summarily deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the\nspecifics in the Court’s order.\n\nThe claim that “[d]Juring Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted she was in receipt of\ndocuments that were handed to her by the atorneys” does not justify the confiscation and review\nof Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell was in\nreceipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did not hand to\nMs. Maxwell any documents that did not originate from Ms. Maxwell. Further, it was after Ms.\nMaxwell called counsel to report that her documents were seized and counsel, in turn, informed\nMs. Maxwell that a complaint would be made that MDC staff contacted legal counsel.\n\nOnce again, the Court is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.\nPapapetru was not present during the legal visit, does not claim to have reviewed the video\nrecording of the legal visit, and failed to provide any helpful or reliable information (either by\nway of an affidavit or declaration or a copy of the recording) to rebut the claims before the\nCourt. A recycled reporting of the guards’ inaccurate observation is an inadequate response to a\nsignificant problem. The MDC has failed to offer any legitimate, fact-based explanation for\nviolation of Ms. Maxwell’s 6 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s\nresponse and order the relief requested on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nConsidering the MDC’s atempt to cast the conduct of its staff in a positive light while\ncasting aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and counsel, we request that the Court direct that the guards\nresponsible for the inappropriate seizure be summoned to Court and a copy of the video\nrecording be provided to defense counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 26l Filed o5/o3/2l Page3of9 3\nL4N3MAXC Arraignment\n\nl reiterate, federal law prohibits the recording or\n\n2 rebroadcasting of this proceeding.

The Rule provides that the\ndefense, like the prosecution, must produce witness statements. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\"Ms. Maxwell understands that the Court has ordered that “The Defendant’s Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) disclosures and witness list are due three weeks before the trial\ncommencement date.” See Dkt.

But I am not faced with that situation.\n\nNothing in this record suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to\n\ndo with the Government’s decision to convene a grand jury to look into the maters\n\nthat were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the Government has\n\nadvised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties\n\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the\n\nGovernment that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its\n\nfiles because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of\n\n“collusion,” to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller\n\ndid not foment the Government’s investigation.

R. Civ. P.\n3o(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct l7 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal\nsupport, Plaintiff atempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of\nseven hours with a right to take a total of 7o hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of\nthe Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and\nspeaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent\nlimitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.\n\nThe heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied\nPlaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. This dashed Plaintiff's apparent\nhope to obtain an adverse inference, rather than actually having to prove her case against Ms.\nMaxwell.

Ms. Maxwell did not avoid any questions and answered\nall questions to the best of her recollection relating to alleged events l5 years ago. The majority of the\nbullet point “summary” of the maters about which Ms. Maxwell could not testify were based either on a\nlack of any personal knouledge or the fact that the events claimed by Plaintiff did not actually happen.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004205.jpg": "Casask 2olG-GN89aPARWsP asyeuMneAePss AritecheAensl pdgage df afil2\nand (c) facts demonstrating that the burden and expense of the discovery is justified by the needs\nof this case. Indeed, she has not established that the testimony is even relevant to the actual\nissues in this mater. Plaintiff's inability to establish these factors requires denial of the motion.\nI. PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST IS PREMATURE\n\nFirst, the request to exceed the presumptive ten-deposition limit is premature. “[C]ourts\ngenerally will not grant leave to expand the number of depositions until the moving party has\nexhausted the ten depositions permited as of right under Rule 3o(a)(2)(A) or the number\nstipulated to by the opposing party,” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., No. 3:o6-CV-\n232 (CFD), 2oo6 WL l52597o, at *2 (D. Conn. May 25, 2oo6).\n\nThis guideline makes sense because a “moving party must not only justify those\ndepositions it wishes to take, but also the depositions it has already taken.” /d. (citing Barrou v.\nGreenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2o2 F.R.D. 48o, 482 (N.D.Tex. 2ool)). This rule is in place because\n“a party could indirectly circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum alloted\nnumber to those that she could not justify under the Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek{[ ]\nleave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate.” Jd. at 483.\n\nHere, Plaintiff seeks a pre-emptive determination that she should be permited l7\ndepositions, almost twice the presumptive limit, yet her proposed depositions are not calculated\nto lead to admissible evidence in this case. By way of example, Plaintiff identifies Nadia\nMarcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or Sarah Vickers), and Jeffrey Epstein as\nalleged “co-conspirators” with each other.

Plaintiff's\nallegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the\ncountry. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell. Again, such duplicative\nand irrelevant deposition testimony speaks to the intended purpose of the ten-deposition limit,\nnot a reason to exceed that limit.\n\nThe same holds true for Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or\nSarah Vickers) and Jeffrey Epstein, each of whom Plaintiff anticipates will not respond to\nquestions and invoke their Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right. As discussed above, such invocation has no\nbearing on the issues in this mater. Moreover, it is obviously cumulative and duplicative.\n\nPlaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any\ninformation from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject mater of their\nexpected testimony. Thus, it is unclear hou these individuals have information that differs from\nor would add to the other proposed deponents. It is the Plaintiff's burden to explain to the Court\nwhy these depositions should be permited if they exceed the presumptive limit, why the\ninformation would not be cumulative, and its relevance to the important issues in the action, or\nthe importance of the discovery in resolving those issues.

By the government’s oun admission, Accuser-3 will not\ntestify, and the government cannot prove, that Accuser-3 Pe\neven if Accuser-3 testifies in accordance with the proffer, the government will be unable to\nestablish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity.“\n\nThe government argues that it “does not mater” whether Accuser-3 was an adult when\ninvited to travel (Opp. l62), because even evidence that she was invited to travel as an adult\nwould be “probative” of Ms. Maxwell’s “intent, in her initial interactions with [Accuser-3], to\nentice [Accuser-3] to travel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.” Opp.\nl63. But there is nothing unlawful about “entic[ing]” an adult to “travel and be transported for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual acts” if those acts themselves are entirely lawful. Nor does\nMs. Maxwell’s alleged role in Accuser-3’s purported lawful sexual activity with Epstein in\nEngland, while Accuser-3 was allegedly under age l8, evince an intent to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel before she turned l8.\n\n* In addressing the sufficiency of allegations in the similar context of a motion to dismiss, courts have recognized\nthat they are limited to consideration of the language of the indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Sharpe, 438 F.3d\nl257, l263 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (“a district court is limited to reviewing the face of the indictment’) (emphasis in\noriginal); United States v.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l66 of 349\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o).

USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.’\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27l of 349\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°?

As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 326 of 349\n\n3.

Losada, 674 F.2d l67, l69 (2d Cir. l982).4\nThere, as here, any barrier to prosecution of the defendant arose from the agreement with the\nprosecution, not the Double Jeopardy Clause. And, as described above, the NPA presents no\nbarrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six should be denied.\n\nIl. Counts Five and Six Are Timely\n\nCounts Five and Six are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse . . .\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and the victim identified in Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment remains alive. The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “essential ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later prosecuted the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page6of2l\n\nA. The Government did not violate Maxwell’s right against self-incrimination\n\nThe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The [Supreme] Court has held\nrepeatedly that the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is limited to prohibiting the use of ‘physical or moral\ncompulsion’ exerted on the person asserting the privilege.” Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S.\n39l, 397 (l976) (quoting Perlman v. United States, 247 U.S. 7, l5 (l9l8)). It does not prohibit\nthe Government from using a defendant’s voluntary statements in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.\n\nTo establish a violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination, Maxwell must\n“demonstrate the existence of three elements: l) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication,\nand 3) the incriminating nature of that communication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d\nll66, ll68 (2d Cir. l987). Maxwell contends that the Government violated her right against\ncompelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies of her deposition transcripts from her earlier\ncivil case. She acknouledges that she could have, but did not, invoke her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nrights to avoid providing incriminating testimony. See, e.g., Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe protective order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a subsequent criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\nprotective order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no guarantee that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v. Stat. Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir.\nl989). As the Second Circuit has explained, a civil protective order may (as here) be overturned\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page/7of2l\nor modified by another court in another proceeding. /d. A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil protective order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; Giuffre v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a reasonable basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil protective order against the use of their testimony in a\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page9of2l\n396 U.S. at 82. In these circumstances, the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> does not bar the Government’s use\nof her testimony in a prosecution for perjury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell is not entitled to suppress her deposition\ntranscripts based on her right against compelled self-incrimination.\n\nB. Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in\n\ncivil litigation\n\n“The Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protects ‘[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.’” Carpenter v. United\nStates, l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l3 (2ol8) (alteration in original) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV).\nGovernment activity qualifies as a search under the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> only if it involves a\nphysical intrusion into a constitutionally protected space or the violation of a person’s\n“reasonable expectation of privacy.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 4oo, 4o6-o7 (2ol2)\n(quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 36o (l967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Thus,\ngovernment agents need a warrant to rummage through someone’s home, listen in on their phone\ncalls, or search through their phones seized incident to arrest. The Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> imposes\nno limitation on their ability to gather evidence of public activity or review public records.\n\nA person has a reasonable expectation of privacy only if they seek to keep something\nprivate and have an objectively reasonable expectation that it will remain private. Smith v.\nMaryland, 442 U.S. 735, 74o (l979). The Supreme Court has held that people generally lack a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily disclose to others. See id. at\n743-44; United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 44o (l976). This is true even if they expect that\ninformation to be safeguarded and used only for specific purposes. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nheld that police may obtain bank records or a list of phone numbers a person has dialed without a\nwarrant. Smith, 442 U.S. at 742; Miller, 425 U.S. at 44o. Ina lone exception to this rule, the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagellof2l\nprotective order. /d. And if confidential materials turn out to be relevant to a court’s ruling,\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that they will be made public\nnotwithstanding any protective order. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. These are not remote or\ntheoretical possibilities. Each of them predictably came to pass in this case. See Broun, 929\nF.3d at 48 & n.22; Giuffre, 827 F. App’x at l45. It is “unrealistic” to believe that deposition\ntestimony central to a civil case of high public interest will remain effectively sealed indefinitely.\nAndover, 876 F.2d at lo83.\n\nMaxwell claims that she did not expect the Government to be able to obtain her\ndeposition testimony, and that if she knew it would, she never would have testified. If Maxwell\nsubjectively harbored this belief, it was nonetheless unreasonable. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743.\nThe Court further notes that Maxwell was ably represented by a number of atorneys during the\ncivil litigation, who the Court is confident were familiar with the precedents governing protective\norders and public access to judicial documents.\n\nBecause Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents shared with\nthird parties during the civil case, the Government did not engage in a search when it obtained\nthose documents from a third party by subpoena. Maxwell also makes a half-hearted argument\nthat obtaining those documents was a seizure of her personal property. Copies of documents\nheld by a law firm that represented Maxwell’s adversary in a civil case were not Maxwell’s\npersonal property. Thus, the Government engaged in neither a search nor a seizure, and so it did\nnot violate Maxwell’s Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe Government also contends that even if it improperly obtained documents pursuant to\nthe grand jury subpoena, the Court should not suppress those documents because the\nGovernment acted in good faith and would have obtained the documents anyway. See Nix v.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel2 of 2l\nWilliams, 467 U.S. 43l, 446 (l984); United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (l984). The Court\nagrees that, at the very least, the exception to the exclusionary rule for inevitable discovery\napplies to the documents that have since been unsealed and made public in the civil case. But\nbecause the Court finds no violation of the Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, it concludes that none of the\ndocuments should be suppressed.\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent\n\nauthority\n\nMaxwell next argues that the materials must be suppressed because the Government\nviolated her due process rights in obtaining them. The gravamen of this claim is that the\nGovernment misrepresented its prior contacts with BSF to Judge McMahon. Maxwell contends\nthat this misrepresentation violated her due process rights, or alternatively that the Court should\nexercise its inherent authority to suppress the evidence obtained through the subpoena as a\nsanction for governmental misconduct. She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result. She further seeks an evidentiary\nhearing to explore whether any misrepresentation by the Government in that hearing was\nintentional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts have a limited inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence obtained in “willful disobedience of law.” United States v. Payner, 447 USS.\n727, 735 n.7 (l98o) (quoting McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 345 (l943)). But it has\nalso cautioned that courts must exercise this pouer with restraint. /d. Thus, “the court should\nnot exercise its inherent or supervisory pouer ‘as a substitute for Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nJurisprudence.’” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting United\nStates v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 792 (2d Cir. l996)).

Dkt. No. l34, at l4. In any event, the Court is not without guidance on when a\nprosecutor’s misrepresentation requires a court to suppress evidence. Precedent requires courts\nto adhere to the standards governing analogous Fourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> claims when asked to\nsuppress evidence under their inherent authority. See Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol-o2.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a clear standard governing when a misrepresentation to a\nmagistrate in a warrant affidavit justifies suppression of evidence obtained as a result. See\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978). That standard requires more than an inadvertent\nmisstatement. “To suppress evidence obtained pursuant to an affidavit containing erroneous\ninformation, the defendant must shou that: (l) the claimed inaccuracies or omissions are the\nresult of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth; and (2) the alleged\nfalsehoods or omissions were necessary to the issuing judge’s probable cause finding.” United\nStates v. Canfield, 2l2 F.3d 7l3, 7l7-l8 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Franks forecloses the argument that all misstatements to a court—even all intentional\nmisstatements—necessarily require suppression. A defendant cannot circumvent this standard\nby couching the same arguments in due process or the court’s inherent authority instead. See\nPayner, 447 U.S. at 736.\n\nFranks also defines the standard governing when a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on a motion to suppress based on the Government’s misrepresentation to a court. To\njustify an evidentiary hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary shouing” of a\ndeliberately or recklessly false statement and that the alleged false statement was necessary to the\ncourt’s decision. Franks, 438 U.S. at l55. “Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are\ninsufficient.” /d. at l7l.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel5of2l\n\nAlthough Maxwell relied on Franks in her opening brief, she argues in reply that she\nneed not satisfy that standard. See Dkt. No. l34, at l6; Dkt. No. 285, at 23. Houever, she\nprovides no explanation for why Franks should not apply. To the extent she offers any\nalternative framework in her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever any\nfactual issue related to a motion to suppress is in dispute. That formulation is far too broad.\n\nThe Court agrees with the Government (and the suggestion in Maxwell’s opening brief)\nthat Franks provides the appropriate standard for whether Maxwell is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on her motion. To be sure, these cases are not identical. Franks dealt with an alleged\nfalse statement in a warrant affidavit. This case involves an alleged false statement in a hearing\nto modify a protective order to allou a grand jury subpoena. Franks involved a claim under the\nFourth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, while Maxwell couches hers in the Fifth. But while not identical, these\nsetings are closely analogous. Each involves alleged misstatements to a court that alloued the\nGovernment to obtain evidence. Each presents a risk of a defense fishing expedition where no\nwrongdoing appears on the face of the Government’s application. Each requires balancing\nsimilar interests—deterrence of deliberate misconduct on the one hand, and suppression of\nevidence inevitably discovered or obtained through innocent error on the other. The Second\nCircuit has already extended Franks past its precise factual context to a motion to suppress based\non alleged misrepresentations in a wiretap application. See United States v. Rajaratnam, 7l9\nF.3d l39, l5l (2d Cir. 2ol3). The Court concludes that Maxwell must at least meet this standard\nfor a similar claim invoking the Court’s inherent authority.\n\nMaxwell must thus make a substantial preliminary shouing on each of Franks’\nrequirements to justify an evidentiary hearing. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll3 (2d\nCir. l998). That is, she must first make a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4799\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3 of 8o\nevidence upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident\ncould be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”'\n\nSeeking “some measure of justice” for Constand, D.A.

We granted allouance of appeal here as\nwell to consider the admissibility of that prior bad act evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 4o4(b).\nHouever, because our decision on the Castor declination issue disposes of this appeal,\nwe do not address the Rule 4o4(b) claim.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A. Castor to conclude\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge\nagainst [] Cosby related to the Constand incident could be proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 6o.\n\nHaving determined that a criminal trial likely could not be won, D.A. Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, Cosby would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to\ninvoke his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege against self-incrimination for fear that his statements\ncould later be used against him by the Commonwealth. Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can't\n\nsubpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something\n\nillegat—or evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did\n\nsomething illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to\n\nsanctions because you’re under subpoena.\n\nSo the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |\n\ndid in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby\n\nwould not be prosecuted no mater what. As a mater of law, that then made\n\nit so that he could not take the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> ever as a mater of law.\n\nSo | have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term\n\n“agreement,” but everybody has used the wrong word. | told [Cosby’s\n\natorney at the time, Walter] Phillips that | had decided that, because of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 8o\ndefects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to\n\nmake a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.\n\n| told him that | was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not\n\nbe alloued to take the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in the subsequent civil suit that\n\nAndrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of\n\nPennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was\n\nsubpoenaed, he would be required to testify.\n\nBut those two things were not connected one to the other. Mr. Cosby was\n\nnot geting prosecuted at all ever as far as | was concerned. And my belief\n\nwas that, as the Commonwealth and the representative of the sovereign,\n\nthat | had the pouer to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a\n\nmater of law Mr. Cosby would be unable to assert the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in\n\na civil deposition.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than me—and\n\n| had 2o years on the job by that point—agreed with my legal assessment.\n\nAnd he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were\n\nrepresenting Mr. Cosby in the pending civil suit.\n\nId. at 64-66. Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district atorney further\nemphasized that it was “absolutely” his intent to remove “for all time” the possibility of\nprosecution, because “the ability to take the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is also for all time removed.”\nId. at 67.\n\nConsistent with his discussion with Atorney Phillips, D.A. Castor issued another\npress release, this time informing the public that he had decided not to prosecute Cosby.\nThe press release stated, in full:\n\nMontgomery County District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. has announced\n\nthat a joint investigation by his office and the Cheltenham Tounship Police\n\nDepartment into allegations against actor and comic Bill Cosby is\n\nconcluded. Cosby maintains a residence in Cheltenham Tounship,\n\nMontgomery County.\n\nA 3l year old female, a former employee of the Athletic Department of\n\nTemple University complained to detectives that Cosby touched her\n\ninappropriately during a visit to his home in January of 2oo4.

Castor did not communicate to Constand or her counsel his decision to\npermanently forego prosecuting Cosby. In fact, Constand did not learn of the decision\nuntil a reporter appeared at one of her civil atorney’s offices later that evening. With the\nresolution of her allegations removed from the criminal courts, Constand turned to the\ncivil realm. On March 8, 2ol5, less than one month after the district atorney’s press\nrelease, Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.®\n\nDuring discovery in that lawsuit, Cosby sat for four depositions. Cosby's atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom Cosby’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of Cosby’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived Cosby of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did Cosby\ninvoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised Cosby not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.’ Nor did Cosby claim the protections of the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that privilege. In fact, no one involved\nwith either side of the civil suit indicated on the record a belief that Cosby could be\nprosecuted in the future. D.A. Castor’s decision was not included in any writen\nstipulations, nor was it reduced to writing.\n\n6 See Constand v. Cosby, Docket No. 2:o5-cv-olo99-ER.\nt Constand’s atorneys subsequently filed a motion to compel Cosby to answer.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l7 of 8o\nFirst Assistant District Atorney Kevin R.

So you almost certainly knou\n\nthis already. |’m writing to you just in case you might have forgoten what\n\nwe did with Cosby back in 2oo5. Atached is my opinion from then.\n\nOnce we decided that the chances of prevailing in a criminal case were too\n\nremote to make an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve justice\n\nwas to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would have the best chance\n\nof prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby. With the agreement of [Atorney]\n\nPhillips and [Constand’s] lawyers, | wrote the atached as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending. Again, with the\n\nagreement of the defense lawyer and [Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally\n\nand specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\n\nprosecution of Cosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his\n\nFifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing him to\n\nsit for a deposition under oath. [Atorney Phillips] was speaking for Cosby’s\n\nside at the time, but he was in contact with Cosby’s civil lawyers who did\n\nnot deal with me directly that | recall. | only discovered today that [Atorney\n\nPhillips] had died. But those lawyers representing [Constand] civilly, whose\n\nnames | did not remember until | saw them in recent media accounts, were\n\npart of this agreement because they wanted to make Cosby testify. |\n\nbelieved at the time that they thought making him testify would solidify their\n\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the Commonwealth) to\n\npromise not to prosecute him. So in effect, that is what | did. | never made\n\nan important decision without discussing it with you during your tenure as\n\nFirst Assistant.\n\nKnouing the above, | can see no possibility that Cosby’s deposition could\n\nbe used in a state criminal case, because | would have to testify as to what\n\nhappened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression. | cannot\n\" Mr. Steele has since been elected District Atorney of Montgomery County.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 8o\nbelieve any state judge would allou that deposition into evidence, nor\nanything derived therefrom.

Knouing\nthis, unless you can make out a case without that deposition and without\nanything the deposition led you to, | think Cosby would have an action\nagainst the County and maybe even against you personally. That is why |\nhave publically suggested looking for lies in the deposition as an alternative\nnou that we have learned of all these other victims we did not knou about\nat the time we had made the go, no-go decision on arresting Cosby. |\npublically suggested that the DA in California might try a common plan\nscheme or design case using [Constand’s] case as part of the res gestae in\ntheir case.

That led to Cosby\npaying [Constand] a lot of money, a large percentage of which went to her\nlawyers on a contingent fee basis. In my opinion, those facts will render\n\nCosby’s deposition inadmissible in any prosecution in Montgomery County\n\nfor the incident that occurred in January 2oo4 in Cheltenham Tounship.\n\nBruce\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys. He testified that\nshe was to contact the atorneys to let them knou that “Cosby was not going\nto be prosecuted and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 8o\nless than flatering light,” as a threat to Ms. Constand and her atorneys\nshould they atack his office. In a 2ol6 Philadelphia Inquirer article, in\nreference to this same sentence, Castor stated, “I put in there that if any\nevidence surfaced that was admissible | would revisit the issue. And\nevidently, that is what the D.A. is doing.” He testified that he remembered\nmaking that statement but that it referred to the possibility of a prosecution\nbased on other victims in Montgomery County or perjury.\n\nHe testified that the press release was intended for three audiences, the\nmedia, the greater legal community, and the litigants. He testified about\nwhat meaning he hoped that each audience would glean from the press\nrelease. He did not intend for any of the three groups to understand the\nentirety of what he meant. The media was to understand only that [Cosby]\nwould not be arrested. Lawyers would parse every word and understand\nthat he was saying there was enough evidence to arrest [Cosby] but that\nMr. Castor thought the evidence was not credible or admissible. The third\naudience was the litigants, and they were to understand that they did not\nwant to damage the civil case. He then stated that the litigants would\nunderstand the entirety of the press release, the legal community most of it\nand the press litle of it.\nMr. Castor testified that in November of 2ol4 he was contacted by the\nmedia as a result of a joke a comedian made about [Cosby]. Again, in the\nsummer of 2ol5 after the civil depositions were released, media\napproached Mr. Castor. He testified that he told every reporter that he\nspoke to in this time frame that the reason he had declined the charges was\nto strip Mr. Cosby of his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege. He testified that he did\nnot learn the investigation had been reopened until he read in the paper that\n[Cosby] was arrested in December 2ol5, but there was media speculation\nin September 2ol5 that an arrest might be imminent.\nOn September 23, 2ol5, apparently in response to this media speculation,\nunprompted and unsolicited, Mr. Castor sent an email to then District\nAtorney Risa Vetri Ferman. His email indicated, in pertinent part,\n\nI’m writing you just in case you might have forgoten what we\n\ndid with Cosby back in 2oo5. .. Once we decided that the\n\nchances of prevailing in a criminal case were too remote to\n\nmake an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve\n\njustice was to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would\n\nhave the best chance of prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby.\n\nWith the agreement of [Atorney Phillips] and [Constand’s]\n\nlawyer, | wrote the atached [press release] as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending.\n\nAgain, with the agreement of the defense lawyer and\n\n[Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally and specifically bound the\n\nCommonwealth that there would be no state prosecution of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\nCosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ... But those lawyers\nrepresenting [Constand] civilly . .. were part of this agreement\nbecause they wanted to make Cosby testify. | believed at the\ntime that they thought making him testify would solidify their\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the\nCommonwealth) to promise not to prosecute him. So in effect,\nthat is what | did. | never made an important decision without\ndiscussing it with you during your tenure as First Assistant.\n\n[B]ut one thing is fact. The Commonwealth, defense and civil\n\nplaintiff's lawyers were all in agreement that the atached\n\ndecision from me stripped Cosby of his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination forcing him to be deposed.\nHe indicated in his email that he learned Mr. Phillips had died on the date\nof his email. The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be prosecuted. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday. The first | heard of a writen declaration documenting the\nagreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/l5 and published today\nby Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that\n\nwe would not prosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers\n\nfor the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed\n\nand the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so Cosby could not\n\ntake the 5\" <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to avoid being deposed or\n\ntestifying. ... That meant to all involved, including Cosby’s\n\nlawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in the\n\ncivil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution for the event we had him under investigation for\n\nin early 2oo5. | signed the press release for precisely this\n\nreason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the\n\nacquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and complete\n\nintent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 8o\n\nthe civil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing\n\nhim to be deposed and perhaps testify in a civil trial without\n\nthe ability to “take the 5.” | decided to create the best\n\npossible environment for the Plaintiff to prevail and be\n\ncompensated. By signing my name as District Atorney and\n\nissuing the atached, | was “signing off” on the Commonwealth\n\nnot being able to use anything Cosby said in the civil case\n\nagainst him in a criminal prosecution, because | was stating\n\nthe Commonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for the\n\nincident based on the then-available evidence in order to help\n\nthe Plaintiff prevail in her civil action . . . [nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity. At no time during the civil suit did Ms. Troiani\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 8o\nreceive any information in discovery or from [Cosby’s] atorneys indicating\nthat [Cosby] could never be prosecuted.\n\nMs. Troiani testified that she understood the press release to say that Mr.\nCastor was not prosecuting at that time but if additional information arose,\nhe would change his mind. She did not take the language, “District Atorney\nCastor cautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision\nshould the need arise,” to be a threat not to speak publicly. She continued\nto speak to the press; Mr. Castor did not retaliate.\nMs. Troiani was present for [Cosby’s] depositions. At no point during the\ndepositions was there any mention of an agreement or promise not to\nprosecute. In her experience, such a promise would have been put on the\nrecord at the civil depositions. She testified that during the four days of\ndepositions, [Cosby] was not cooperative and the depositions were\nextremely contentious. Ms. Troiani had to file motions to compel [Cosby’s]\nanswers. [Cosby’s] refusal to answer questions related to Ms. Constand’s\nallegations formed the basis of a motion to compel. When Ms. Troiani\natempted to question [Cosby] about the allegations, [Cosby’s] atorneys\nsought to have his statement to police read into the record in lieu of cross\nexamination.\nMs. Troiani testified that one of the initial provisions [Cosby] wanted in the\ncivil setlement was a release from criminal liability. [Cosby’s civil atorney\nPatrick] O’Conner’s leter to Ms. Ferman does not dispute this fact. [Cosby]\nand his atorneys also requested that Ms. Troiani agree to destroy her file,\nshe refused. Eventually, the parties agreed on the language that Ms.\nConstand would not initiate any criminal complaint. The first Ms. Troiani\nheard of a promise not to prosecute was in 2ol5. The first Ms. Kivitz learned\nof the purported promise was in a 2ol4 newspaper article.\nJohn P. Schmit, Esq., testified that he has represented [Cosby] since l983.\nIn the early l99os, he became [Cosby’s] general counsel. In 2oo5, when\nhe became aware of the instant allegations, he retained criminal counsel,\nWilliam Phillips, Esq., on [Cosby’s] behalf. Mr. Phillips dealt directly with\nthe prosecutor’s office and would then discuss all maters with Mr. Schmit.\n[Cosby’s] January 2oo5 interview took place at Mr. Schmit’s office. Both\nMr. Schmit and Mr. Phillips were present for the interview. Numerous\nquestions were asked the answers to which could lead to criminal charges.\nAt no time during his statement to police did [Cosby] invoke the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> or refuse to answer questions. Mr. Schmit testified that he had\ninterviewed [Cosby] prior to his statement and was not concerned about his\nanswers. Within weeks of the interview, the District Atorney declined to\nbring a prosecution. Mr. Schmit testified that Mr. Phillips told him that the\ndecision was an irrevocable commitment that District Atorney Castor was\nnot going to prosecute [Cosby]. He received a copy of the press release.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 25\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 8o\n\nOn March 8, 2oo5, Ms. Constand filed her civil suit and Mr. Schmit retained\n\nPatrick O’Conner, Esq., as civil counsel. Mr. Schmit participated in the civil\n\ncase. [Cosby] sat for four days of depositions. Mr. Schmit testified that\n\n[Cosby] did not invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> in those depositions and that\n\nhe would not have let him sit for the depositions if he knew the criminal case\n\ncould be reopened.\n\nHe testified that generally he does try to get agreements on [Cosby’s] behalf\n\nin writing. During this time period, Mr. Schmit was involved in writen\n\nnegotiations with the National Enquirer. He testified that he relied on the\n\npress release, Mr. Castor’s word and Mr. Phillips’ assurances that what Mr.\n\nCastor did was sufficient. Mr. Schmit did not personally speak to Mr. Castor\n\nor get the assurance in writing. During the depositions, Mr. O’Conner\n\nobjected to numerous questions. At the time of the depositions, Mr. Schmit,\n\nthrough his negotiations with the National Enquirer, learned that there were\n\nJane Doe witnesses making allegations against [Cosby]. [Cosby] did not\n\nassert a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege when asked about these other women.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that he had not formed an opinion as to whether Mr.\n\nCastor’s press release would cover that testimony.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that during negotiations of the setlement agreement\n\nthere were references to a criminal case. The setlement agreement\n\nindicated that Ms. Constand would not initiate a criminal case against Mr.\n\nCosby. Mr. Schmit did not come forward when he learned the District\n\nAtorney’s office re-opened the case in 2ol5.\n\nT.C.O. at 47-6l (cleaned up).\n\nNotably, when District Atorney Castor decided not to prosecute Cosby, he\n“absolutely” intended to remove “for all time” the possibility of prosecution, because “the\nability to take the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> is also for all time removed.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67.\nThe trial court sought clarification from Mr. Castor about his statement in his second email\nto D.A. Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\nCosby’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of Cosby’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A. Castor stated that what he\nwas “trying to convey to Mrs. Ferman [was that his] binding of the Commonwealth not to\nprosecute Cosby was not for any crime in Montgomery County for all time. It was only\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3o of 8o\n\nAs further support for the view that no agreement was reached, nor any promise\nextended, the trial court noted that, in his initial statement to police, which was voluntarily\nprovided and not under oath, Cosby did not invoke his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since Cosby previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that Cosby subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\nCosby could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d. Specifically, the court noted that Cosby was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay. This Court likewise rejected Cosby’s pre-trial efforts to appeal the\nadverse rulings, denying his petition for allouance of appeal, his petition for review, and\nhis emergency petition for a stay of the proceedings.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 46 of 8o\nNational Enquirer on the details of its published interview with Cosby, and that Atorney\nSchmit negotiated a term of the setlement agreement with Constand that required her\nassurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation. Thus, the\nCommonwealth argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that “[i]Jt was not necessary for\nthe trial court to specifically state that it rejected .. . Schmit’s testimony, as it is patently\nobvious that his testimony belies his claim that there was some ‘promise’ from [Mr.] Castor\nnot to prosecute.” /d. (quoting Commonwealth’s Superior Court Brief at l36-37). The\nSuperior Court agreed that “the evidence was entirely inconsistent with [Cosby's] alleged\nreliance on Mr. Castor’s promise in choosing not to assert his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege\nin the civil suit.” /d. at 4l3-l4.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s claim that the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his deposition testimony due to the immunity that he\npurportedly should have enjoyed. The court opined that Cosby’s suppression argument\nwas “contingent upon his claim that Mr. Castor unilaterally immunized [Cosby] from\ncriminal prosecution, which we have already rejected.” /d. at 4l4. The panel\ndistinguished all of the precedents upon which Cosby relied, including this Court’s\ndecision in Commonwealth v. Stipetich, 652 A.2d l294 (Pa. l995).\n\nIn Stipetich, Pitsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich\nthat, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no\ncharges would be filed against them. After the Stipetiches fulfilled their part of the\nagreement, prosecutors charged them anyway. /d. at l294-95.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool).

Castor’s testimony as inconsistent and\nequivocal finds support in the record as well. At times, the former district atorney was\nemphatic that he intended his decision not to prosecute Cosby to bind the Commonwealth\npermanently, provided no substantive changes occurred in the case, such as Cosby\nconfessing to the alleged crimes or proof appearing that Cosby had lied to, or atempted\nto deceive, the investigators. In addition to the unconditional nature of the press release,\nformer D.A. Castor told then-District Atorney Ferman in his first email to her that he\n“intentionally and specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\nprosecution.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, Mr. Castor\nasserted that, by “signing off on the press release, he was “stating that the\nCommonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for this incident based upon then-\navailable evidence.” /d., Exh. D-7.\n\nFurther indicative of his intent to forever preclude prosecution of Cosby for the\n2oo4 incident, former D.A. Castor testified that the signed press release was meant to\nserve as proof for a future civil judge that Cosby would not be prosecuted, thus stripping\nCosby of his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right not to testify. Mr. Castor emphasized that his decision\nwas “absolute that [Cosby] never would be prosecuted.” T.C.O. at 52. The former district\natorney stressed that his intent was to “absolutely” remove “for all time” the prospect of\na prosecution, because, in his view, only a steadfast guarantee would permanently strip\nCosby of his right to invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67. Mr. Castor also\nexpounded upon the purpose of his emails to D.A. Ferman, which he claimed were an\natempt to inform her that, while he bound the Commonwealth with regard to the 2oo4\nincident, she was free to prosecute Cosby for any other crimes that she might uncover.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 59 of 8o\n\nThere is no doubt that promises made during plea negotiations or as part of fully\nconsummated plea agreements differ in kind from the unilateral discretion exercised when\na prosecutor declines to pursue criminal charges against a defendant. As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process. See\nCommonwealth v. Sims, 9l9 A.2d 93l, 94l n.6 (Pa. 2oo7) (noting that federal and state\ndue process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively). We have\nexplained that review of a due process claim “entails an assessment as to whether the\nchallenged proceeding or conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6l of 8o\n\nAn entirely different situation arises when the decision not to prosecute is\nunconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it\ninduces the defendant to act in reliance thereupon. When a non-prosecution decision is\nconveyed in such a way, and when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,\ndetrimentally relies upon that decision, due process may warrant preclusion of the\nprosecution. Numerous state and federal courts have found that a defendant's\ndetrimental reliance upon the government's assurances during the plea bargaining phase\nboth implicates his due process rights and entitles him to enforcement even of\nunconsummated agreements. The cases are legion.*°\nae See, e.g., State v. Francis, 424 P.3d l56, l6o (Utah 2ol7) (holding that, “[W]hen a\ndefendant has reasonably and detrimentally relied on a plea agreement, the State should\nnot be able to withdraw a plea agreement just because it has not yet been presented to\nthe district court”); State v. Johnson, 36o S.W.3d lo4, ll5 (Ark. 2olo) (holding that, “when\nthe State has entered into an agreement not to prosecute with a prospective defendant\nand the defendant has performed and acted to his detriment or prejudice in reliance upon\nthat agreement, the government must be required to honor such an agreement.”); People\nv. Rhoden, 89 Cal. Rptr.2d 8l9, 824 (Cal.

Streebing, 987 F.2d 368, 372-73 (6th Cir. l993) (holding\nthat the defendant had to demonstrate, inter alia, that he had relied upon the\ngovernment’s promise to his detriment before the promise would be enforceable); United\nStates v. Savage, 978 F.2d ll36, ll38 (9th Cir. l992) (explaining that a defendant’s\ndetrimental reliance is an exception to the general rule that defendants are not entitled to\nenforcement of unconsummated plea agreements); State v. Parkey, 47l N.W.2d 896,\n898 (loua App. l99l) (finding that, in the absence of a shouing that the defendant\ndetrimentally relied upon an agreement with the prosecutor, dismissal was not\nwarranted); Roue v.

Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights.\n\nThe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend. V. The right to refuse to incriminate oneself is an “essential mainstay” of our\nconstitutional system of criminal justice. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. l, 7 (l964). The\nprivilege constitutes an essential restraint upon the pouer of the government, and stands\nas an indispensable rampart between that government and the governed. The Fifth\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 66 of 8o\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>'s self-incrimination clause “is not only a protection against conviction and\nprosecution but a safeguard of conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression\nas well.” Ullmann v. United States, 35o U.S. 422, 445 (l956) (Douglas, J., dissenting).\n\nWe recently discussed the centrality of the privilege against compulsory self-\nincrimination in the American concept of ordered liberty in Commonwealth v. Taylor, 23o\nA.3d lo5o (Pa. 2o2o). There, we noted that certain rights, such as those enshrined in\nthe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, are among those privileges “whose exercise a State may not\ncondition by the exaction of a price.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S.\n493, 5oo (l967)). To ensure that these fundamental freedoms are “scrupulously\nobserved,” we emphasized that “it is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional\nrights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon,” id. at lo63-64\n(quoting Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6, 635 (l886)), and that “the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nis to be “broad[ly] constru[ed] in favor of the right which it was intended to secure.” /d. at\nlo64 (quoting Counselman v.

We stressed that “[t]he value\nof constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on\nthem.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 425 (l957) (Black,\nJ., concurring).2°\n\nThe right against compulsory self-incrimination accompanies a person wherever\nhe goes, no mater the legal proceeding in which he participates, unless and until “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exists.” Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo65. It\n26 To that end, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination is not limited\nto criminal maters. Its availability “does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its\nprotection is invoked, but upon the nature of the statement or admission and the exposure\nwhich it invites.” /d. (quoting Application of Gault, 387 U.S. l, 49 (l967)). “The privilege\nmay, for example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or\nmay be inculpatory.” Gault, 387 U.S. at 49.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004879.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 67 of 8o\nis indisputable that, in Constand’s civil case, Cosby was entitled to invoke the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. No court could have forced Cosby to testify in a deposition or at a trial so\nlong as the potential for criminal charges remained. Here, houever, when called for\ndeposition, Cosby no longer faced criminal charges. When compelled to testify, Cosby\nno longer had a right to invoke his right to remain silent.\n\nCosby was forced to sit for four depositions. That he did not—and could not—\nchoose to remain silent is apparent from the record. When Cosby atempted to decline\nto answer certain questions about Constand, Constand’s atorneys obtained a ruling from\nthe civil trial judge forcing Cosby to answer. Most significantly, Cosby, having maintained\nhis innocence in all maters and having been advised by a number of atorneys, provided\ncritical evidence of his recurring history of supplying women with central nervous system\ndepressants before engaging in (allegedly unwanted) sexual activity with them—the very\nassertion that undergirded Constand’s criminal complaint.\n\nThe trial court questioned whether Cosby believed that he no longer had a Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to invoke during the civil proceedings, or whether he would have\ninvoked that right had he still possessed it. The court noted that Cosby voluntarily had\nsubmited to a police interview and had provided the police with a consent-based defense.\nCosby repeated this narrative in his depositions. The court found no reason to believe\nthat Cosby would not continue to cooperate as he had, and, thus, discerned no reason\nfor him to invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. In other words, it was not that the trial court\nsurmised that Cosby had no privilege against compulsory self-incrimination to invoke, but\nrather that Cosby simply chose not to invoke it.\n\nThe trial court’s conjecture was legally erroneous. The trial court surmised that,\nalthough Cosby repeatedly told an exculpatory, consent-based version of the January\n2oo4 incident, he naturally would have been willing to offer inculpatory information about\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 69 of 8o\n\nWe already have determined that Cosby in fact relied upon D.A.

The record establishes without contradiction\nthat depriving Cosby of his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right was D.A. Castor’s intended result.2’\nHis actions were specifically designed to that end. The former district atorney may have\nequivocated or contradicted himself years later with regard to hou he endeavored to\nachieve that result, but there has never been any question as to what he intended to\nachieve. There can be no doubt that, by choosing not to prosecute Cosby and then\n27 The dissent asserts that we have predicated our decision upon the existence of an\n“unwriten promise,” which was rejected by the trial court’s credibility findings. D.O. at 3.\nTo the contrary. As we explained earlier, we have accepted the trial court’s findings in\nthis regard, and those findings, which are supported by the record, are binding on this\nCourt. See, supra, page 48 (citing O’Rourke, 778 A.2d at ll99 (Pa. 2ool)). Houever,\nour deference is limited to the factual findings only; we may draw our oun inferences\ntherefrom and reach our oun legal conclusions. See /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d at 63l.\nThus, the trial court’s factual finding that no formal bargained-for-exchange, writen or\nunwriten, occurred does not constrain our legal analysis, nor does it in any way serve to\nimmunize D.A. Castor’s actions from constitutional scrutiny. That there was no formal\npromise does not mean that Cosby no longer had due process rights.\n\nThe trial court’s credibility finding regarding the existence vel non of a particular\npromise does not allou us to ignore the remainder of the overwhelming evidence of\nrecord. The record firmly establishes that D.A. Castor’s desired result was to strip Cosby\nof his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. This patent and developed fact stands separate and apart\nfrom the trial court’s finding that D.A. Castor never extended a formal promise.\n\nThe dissent would ignore the undeniable reality that Cosby relied to his detriment\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision. The dissent does so by shifting the perspective from D.A.\nCastor’s actions to Cosby’s, focusing in particular upon the fact that Cosby did not record\nthe purported agreement or reduce it to writing. As we note in this opinion, in this context,\nneither a promise, nor an agreement, nor a contract, nor evidence of reliance derives\nlegal validity only upon being recorded or upon writen materialization. The law knous no\nsuch prerequisite, and Cosby cannot be punished for failing to comply with a legal\nrequirement that does not exist. The proof of Cosby’s reliance is plain on the face of the\nrecord. It is the fact that, upon the advice and assistance of counsel, Cosby sat for four\ndepositions and incriminated himself, obviously a decision made after and in direct\nreliance upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law. If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance.

Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process. See Roue, 676 F.2d at 528 (explaining that, when\na promise induces a defendant to waive his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights by testifying or\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\nCosby’s deposition testimony will remedy his constitutional harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A. Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, exclusion of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 78 of 8o\nmore, falls short of what our law demands. Though this appeal emanates from Cosby’s\ncriminal convictions, we cannot ignore the true breadth of the due process violation. The\ndeprivation includes the fact that D.A. Castors actions handicapped Cosby in the\nderivative civil suit. Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening Cosby’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore Cosby to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no exclusion of deposition testimony can restore Cosby’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed Cosby. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that Cosby was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those prosecutions involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies. Critically, none of them featured the additional harm inflicted in\nthis case. In none of those cases did the effects of the constitutional violation extend to\nmaters beyond the criminal trial, as was the circumstance here. Accordingly, none of\nthose cases support, much less compel, the limited remedy that the CDO proffers.\n\nThe impact of the due process violation here is vast. The remedy must match that\nimpact. Starting with D.A. Castors inducement, Cosby gave up a fundamental\nak Id. at l.\n\n38 See CDO at 6-8 (citing Stipetich, Commonwealth v. Peters, 373 A.2d lo55 (Pa.\nl977); Commonwealth v.

The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 27\n.

In )\nMartindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |\n“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the maters in connection with |\nwhich the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |\ngrand jury investigative processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |\nthe mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 4o |\nF.3d 592 (2d Cir. l994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :\nshouing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |\none day invoke the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |\nprosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |\ncivil proceeding]...

Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a situation in |\nwhich the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |\nindependently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743.

Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument.

The\nissues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related to\nthe use of pseudonyms and other artifices fails becausc\nRee 2¢ limitations suggested by the government will: (l) unconstitutionally\nrestrict Ms. Maxwell’s confrontation rights; (2) run afoul of both her right to a public trial and\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access, and (3) are simply unworkable as a practical mater\ninviting a mistrial.\n\nA. The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allou the trial court to rule in advance of trial on\nthe admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude anticipated prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d\nl36, l4l (2d Cir. l996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by\nenabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 69\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted\nwith the witnesses against her. The right to confront means more than being alloued to confront\nthe witness physically. The main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the\nopponent the opportunity of cross-examination. Delaware v. Van Arsdail, 475 U.S. 673, 678\n(l986).\n\nHere, the government seeks to strip Ms. Maxwell of her right to confront the witnesses.\nThe identity, occupations, and backgrounds of the accusers is material and relevant to the\ndefense of this case for many reasons. First, i. A jury\nshould be able to evaluate the testimony knouing that [yy\nEEE\nRe 2cluding when the allegations may or may not\nhave occurred, whether any action atributed to Ms. Maxwell could be considered “grooming,”\nand the resources available to the accusers at any point in tine. yy\nee)\nHM -Each of these items of cross-examination will further expose the identities of the\nwitness.\n\nHE background and circumstances are also relevant.\neee\na\nee\na\nMM Being part of the government’s case here obviated any need for actual proof to the fund.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 69\nmotive to fabricate arose immediately after the supposed child-abuse, and thus statements made\nto others, months or years later, were inadmissible under nou-Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(). The same is\ntrue here. The improper influence and motive to fabricate occurred, in several instances, many\nyears ago, shortly after the purported abuse occurred, and before the recently-disclosed\n\"consistent\" statements. Wright & Miller, 3oB Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6753 Consistent\nPremotive Statements (2o2l ed.) (\"As in Tome, prior consistent statements will frequently be\ntainted by the same alleged motive to lie that is claimed to impugn the witness' trial testimony. If\nso, Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i) does not permit their introduction. This result has favorable policy\nimplications. As Tome stresses, the general exclusion of prior consistent statements ensures that\n‘the whole emphasis of the trial’ does not “shift to the out-of-court statements” as opposed to 'the\nin-court ones.\"\").\n\nIf the government instead offers prior consistent statements to rehabilitate their accusers\nor explain their faulty memory under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), the \"offered prior consistent\nstatement must serve to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility on the same ground upon which the\nwitness’s credibility was atacked.\" United States. v.

In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2ofl2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b).......... cece eccecececeeeeeeeeeseeeseeceaeeeenerseeeseesnasestretsneesteestertreseee\nIl.

R. Evid. 4o4(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended in December\n2o2o, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered,\nan articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that\npurpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\nintroduce evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3). In December 2o2o, the Rule was “amended principally to\nimpose additional notice requirements in a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4, Advisory\nCommitee Notes, 2o2o Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5242.l 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (2o2l).\n\nII. Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\ndetermination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to\" the Rule. See Dkt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005619.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl2\nIndictment.

Given the\ntiming of her stated employment, it also begs the question hou her testimony, reference to\nunspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, \"among other things,\" could be\ndirect evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier.\n\nBut because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed\nmaterials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this ime. yy\nOO —S—CSSCSCsis\nOO —CSSCSCSCSCies\nEES As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to\nreview, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October\nl8, 2o2l due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief\naddressing the proffered 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 4o4(b) since at least\nJanuary 25, 2o2l. See Dkt. l46 at lo.! The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone.

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients.

The Court did not\nbelieve that a limiting instruction would be adequate to mitigate the risk of prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell. /d.\n\nThe Court further found that any consideration of the perjury charges would likely\nrequire disqualification of at least one of her atorneys in the criminal case, two of whom had\nrepresented her at the civil depositions, which would significantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of\n\nat least one of Maxwell’s atorneys from participating as an\n\nadvocate on her behalf.....

Finally, the Court noted that much of the proof relevant\nto the perjury counts was beyond the scope of the “narrouer issues” presented by the other\ncharges, that the perjury counts involved legal and factual questions were “unlikely to bear on\nthe other charges,” and that addressing the perjury counts would involve a “significant\ninvestment of time and resources” that would impair the efficiency of the trial. /d. at 25-26.

[and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation\nagainst Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24.

Introducing evidence related to the perjury counts\nas evidence of alleged concealment, or for any purpose, would present these same problems and\nshould not be alloued.\n\nThird, as the Court recognized in its prior ruling, fully litigating the perjury charges—\nwhich would be necessary if the government were alloued to introduce the allegedly false\ndeposition statements to shou concealment—would result in a distracting and time-intensive\nside-shou at trial that will confuse the jury with legal and factual issues that are far afield from\nthe “narrouer issues” that pertain to the other charged offenses. /d. at 25-26.

App’x 365, 37o\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order). “This is particularly true if, at the time that the expert testimony\nis presented to the jury, a sufficient basis for allouing the testimony is on the record.” Williams,\n5o6 F.3d at l6l (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 7o2.o2 [2] (2d ed. 2oo6)).\n\nFinally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must also be relevant. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l).

Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def.

The Second Circuit “has long adopted an ‘inclusionary’ approach\nto the admission of uncharged crime evidence, under which evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or\nacts is admissible for any purpose other than to shou a defendant’s criminal propensity.” United\nStates v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 2ll, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). Where the\ndefendant claims her conduct has an innocent explanation, the admission of such evidence of other\nacts is particularly appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Zackson, l2 F.3d ll78, ll82 (2d Cir.\nl993) (“Where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation, prior act evidence\nis generally admissible to prove that the defendant acted with the state of mind necessary to commit\nthe offense charged.”). Where evidence is offered for a proper purpose under Rule 4o4(b), it may\nonly be excluded if the probative value of the evidence is “substantially outweighed” by the danger\nof unfair prejudice. /d. at ll82; see Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nUntil December l, 2o2o, the Government was required to provide “reasonable notice of\nthe general nature of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2)(A) (2oll). On December l, 2o2o, the rule was amended (the “2o2o Amendments”) to\nrequire the Government to also “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose.” Fed.

The 2o2o Amendments also removed language permiting notice of\nthe “general nature” of the evidence.\n\nThese amendments are “relatively modest.” Wright & Miller, “2o2o Amendments to Rule\n4o4(b),” 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 5242.l (2d ed.). They simply require the prosecutor to\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the evidence is offered and the basis for concluding\nthat the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.” /d. (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) Advisory\nCommitee note). The other act evidence should also be “described with helpful specificity.” Jd.\n\nB. Discussion\n\nTo be clear, in the Government’s view, the exhibits and testimony discussed in the\nGovernment’s October ll, 2o2l leter are direct evidence of the offenses charged, such that they\ndo not need to be admited pursuant to Rule 4o4(b). And although notice was not required under\nRule 4o4(b), the Government has provided the defense with notice substantially in advance of trial.\nThe Court should admit this evidence, regardless of whether Rule 4o4(b) applies.\n\nl. The Evidence is Admissible As Direct Evidence, or in the Alternative, Under Rule\n\n4o4(b)\n\nThe Government’s October ll leter identified seven exhibits and one witness whose\nstatements are admissible as direct evidence, or in the alternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See October\nll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A at l). More specifically, the leter explained that the\nGovernment may offer at trial a. marked as Government Exhibits 4ol through 4o4,\n4o9 through 4lo, and 4l3. In addition, the Government notified the defense that it may call as a\nwitness an individual (“Employee-l”) who worked for Jeffrey Epstein a immediately\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions.

GOVERNMENT CONCEDEDLY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE\n\nBASIS OR REASONING TO ADMIT ANY 4o4(B) EVIDENCE\n\nThe government concedes that (i) it was aware of the December 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (Resp. at 34), (ll) those Amendments required it to give notice of the \"permited\npurpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the [4o4(b)] evidence and the reasoning that\nsupports the purpose\" (id.) (\"Notice\"), and (i) the October ll \"Maxwell Rule 4o4 Leter\"\n(\"Leter\") did not identify the \"permited purpose\" under Rule 4o4(b) for which the government\nseeks (alternative) admission of the two categories of evidence, nor the \"reasoning that supports\nthat evidence.\"! The government wholly fails to explain why it could not comply with these\n\"relatively modest\" new Notice requirements on the timeline ordered by this Court. Nouhere in\nresponse does the government seek leave for an extension to provide the appropriate Notice out\nof time nor justify its \"good cause\" for failure to timely comply with both the Court's Order and\nthe Rule. Instead, they assert that \"any alleged gap in the Government's notice is remediated by\nthis brief.\" Resp. at 39-4o. To quote the government's response to Ms. Maxwell's motion in\nlimine, \"to the extent the [government] takes issue with the rule\" requiring specific pre-trial\nNotice under Rule 4o4(b), \"that complaint is properly directed to the drafters of the Federal\nRules of Evidence.\" Resp. at 6l n.l5.\n\nHaving failed to comply with the Notice requirements of the Rule by the (extended)\nCourt ordered deadline of October ll, the government belatedly argues that the tendered\nevidence is either direct evidence or admissible under Rule 4o4(b). They are wrong on both\nfronts.\n\n! Under the misleading and disingenuous sub-heading (2) (\"The Government has Met and\nExceeded its Notice Obligations\"), the government points only to its (i) October ll disclosure of certain\nof the evidence (which gives neither a a proper \"purpose\" or \"reasoning\"), and (i) its Response (the\nrequired \"notice is remediated by this brief\").\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005974.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9 of 52\n2. The government has apparently abandoned efforts to introduce her\ntestimony as Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nIn their response, the government still fails to comply with the new Rule 4o4(b) notice\nrequirements. First, they do not actually identify the evidence with any specificity, especially\nwith respect to the \"exhibits\" that they hope to introduce through her. Second, while they use the\nwords \"plan and preparation\" or \"knouledge,\" they fail to explain hou those uses of the\ntestimony are independent of the character / propensity inference banned by Rule 4o4(b). Hou\nare the process and frequency of massages or the sexual nature of massages after the period of\nthe conspiracy proof of a plan or preparation, apart from the propensity inference? A plan or\npreparation usually comes before an event. Planning or preparing for something after it has\noccurred can only be based on an assumption that because you are the kind of person who\nsolicits underage massages later, you must have been the kind of person to do so earlier.\nSimilarly, knouledge after the end of the conspiracy is not the same as knouledge at the time of\nor before the purported charged acts occurred, except by way of propensity. Finally, unspecified\nexhibits, many of which appear to have been writen after the conspiracy (e.g., GX 5o5 — dated\nFeb. l4, 2oo5) cannot likewise be proof of the charged crimes which were allegedly completed\nbefore J shoued up.\n\nBecause the government makes no effort to argue the non-propensity purpose for these\nuses Of J Via Rule 4o4(b), and failed to give notice of the purposes or reason in\nadvance in any event, this Court should exclude the evidence on this ground.\n\n3. ee ©onstitutes an impermissible\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and variance to the Indictment.\n\nFinally, what is clear from the government's proffer in their Response, the anticipated\ntestimony © fll\nRen.

As this Court previously has\nruled:\n\n\"To prevail on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\n\n‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence\n\nand jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that\n\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an\n\noffense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y.

Because the doctrine of constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7. In contrast to a\n\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the\n\nindictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially\n\ndifferent from those alleged in the indictment.” /d.

Oct. l8, 2ol7).\n\nAs this Court then recognized, the Second Circuit has consistently relied on the same\nstart and end dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial proof did not affect a constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance. See id. (\"The indictment and the evidence at trial contained the same\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy...\") (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n229 (2d.

Dupre, 462 F.3d l3l, l4l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"The\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in the indictment correspond to the conspiracy\nproven at trial...\"). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony — for the post-conspiracy\ntime eric {NN\nWE. Who never met any of the four accusers as far as can be gleaned, and the documents she\nintends to authenticate, run a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will not be the\nsame core evidence charged in the Indictment because it will be based on evidence that post-\ndates the events charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 of54\n\n“TT here is no absolute right of an accused to have a jury hear a witness’s true name and\naddress.” Clark v.

The Crime\nVictims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. § 377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to\nensure that crime victims are accorded, among other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably\nprotected from the accused,” and “[t]he right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.” Jd. §§ (a)(l), (a)(8).

In United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (E.D.N.Y.), the Government moved to allou\ntestifying victims to testify “under a nickname, first name, or pseudonym only, and to not be\nrequired to disclose uniquely identifying information,” such as “addresses, names of family\nmembers, or exact places of education or employment.” Order at 29, 32, Raniere, No. l8 Cr.\n2o4 (E.D.N.Y.

The\nissues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related to\nthe use of pseudonyms and other artifices fails becausc\nRee 2¢ Limitations suggested by the government will: (l) unconstitutionally\nrestrict Ms. Maxwell’s confrontation rights; (2) run afoul of both her right to a public trial and\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access, and (3) are simply unworkable as a practical mater\ninviting a mistrial.\n\nA. The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allou the trial court to rule in advance of trial on\nthe admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude anticipated prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d\nl36, l4l (2d Cir. l996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by\nenabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 69\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted\nwith the witnesses against her. The right to confront means more than being alloued to confront\nthe witness physically. The main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the\nopponent the opportunity of cross-examination. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678\n(l986).\n\nHere, the government seeks to strip Ms. Maxwell of her right to confront the witnesses.\nThe identity, occupations, and backgrounds of the accusers is material and relevant to the\ndefense of this case for many reasons. First, x. A jury\nshould be able to evaluate the testimony knouing that |\nOO —CSCSCSC‘CCits\nDe cluding when the allegations may or may not\nhave occurred, whether any action atributed to Ms. Maxwell could be considered “grooming,”\nand the resources available to the accusers at any point in timc. xs\nSSC\nME (Bach of these items of cross-examination will further expose the identities of the\nwitness.\n\nHE background and circumstances are also relevant.\ni —S—“SCSCSCSCies\nOO —“CSCSCSC(‘sisA\nOO —CCSCSC(‘C(C‘Cits\nOO —CSSCSCiCs\nMM Being part of the government’s case here obviated any need for actual proof to the fund.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo645o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 69\nmotive to fabricate arose immediately after the supposed child-abuse, and thus statements made\nto others, months or years later, were inadmissible under nou-Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(). The same is\ntrue here. The improper influence and motive to fabricate occurred, in several instances, many\nyears ago, shortly after the purported abuse occurred, and before the recently-disclosed\n\"consistent\" statements. Wright & Miller, 3oB Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6753 Consistent\nPremotive Statements (2o2l ed.) (\"As in Tome, prior consistent statements will frequently be\ntainted by the same alleged motive to lie that is claimed to impugn the witness' trial testimony. If\nso, Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i) does not permit their introduction. This result has favorable policy\nimplications. As Tome stresses, the general exclusion of prior consistent statements ensures that\n‘the whole emphasis of the trial’ does not “shift to the out-of-court statements” as opposed to 'the\nin-court ones.\"\").\n\nIf the government instead offers prior consistent statements to rehabilitate their accusers\nor explain their faulty memory under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), the \"offered prior consistent\nstatement must serve to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility on the same ground upon which the\nwitness’s credibility was atacked.\" United States. v. Karl Roye, Crim. No. 3:l5-cr-29 (JBA),\n2ol6 WL 4l47l33 at *l (D. Conn. Aug. 4, 2ol6) (citing l McCormick On Evid. § 47 (7th ed.)\n(“The general test of admissibility is whether evidence of the witness’s ... consistent statements\nis logically relevant to explain the impeaching fact. The rehabilitating facts must meet the\nimpeachment with relative directness. The wall, atacked at one point, may not be fortified at\nanother, distinct point.”)). As was the case prior to the 2ol4 Amendments, \"a prior consistent\nstatement may only be used for rehabilitation “when the statement has a probative force bearing\non credibility beyond merely shouing repetition.” United States v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d.\nCir. l986).\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo645l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 69\nfor admissibility. To the extent the government seeks a pretrial ruling that a// prior consistent\nstatements may be admited after any atack on the accusers’ credibility, this Court should deny\nsuch a request.\nIW. EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIOR CHARGING DECISIONS AND\n\nTHE COURSE OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS IS ADMISSIBLE\n\n“The right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is\na fundamental constitutional right secured by both the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>, as well as by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.” United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\naccusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s\noun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006498.jpg": "Case l:l6aS- Al28 6lAGS3HBARnerPacementetea-6n FERS b6Ge/2d5/l7aoe@ IdGe 7 of l5\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is\nmaterial to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach\nof any one of these conditions allous the United States to elect to terminate the agreement\nand to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all\nfederal offenses.\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asseris and certifies that he is aware of the fact that\nthe Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal\nprosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.

Preclusion of the Purported Statements is the Only Appropriate Remedy\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(2)(C) provides that if a party fails to comply with the Court’s\norders regulating discovery the Court may prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed\nevidence as a sanction.\n\nA district court’s decision to impose a Rule l6(d)(2) sanction for the violation of a\ndiscovery order, and thus its choice of sanction, is a mater commited to the Court's sound\ndiscretion. In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page2ofl2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b).......... cece eccecececeeeeeeeeeseeeseeceaeeeenerseeeseesnasestretsneesteestertreseee\nIl.

R. Evid. 4o4(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended in December\n2o2o, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered,\nan articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that\npurpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\nintroduce evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3). In December 2o2o, the Rule was “amended principally to\nimpose additional notice requirements in a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4, Advisory\nCommitee Notes, 2o2o Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5242.l 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (2o2l).\n\nII. Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\ndetermination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to\" the Rule. See Dkt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloofl2\nIndictment.

Given the\ntiming of her stated employment, it also begs the question hou her testimony, reference to\nunspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, \"among other things,\" could be\ndirect evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier.\n\nBut because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed\nmaterials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this time. The emails\ninvolve two persons not interviewed by the Government, so there is no interview memo to\ncorroborate their content. At least two of the potential witnesses are foreign nationals who live\nabroad. Ms. Maxwell will need time to contact and interview them. As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to\nreview, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October\nl8, 2o2l due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief\naddressing the proffered 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 4o4(b) since at least\nJanuary 25, 2o2l. See Dkt. l46 at lo.' The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone. See Dkt. 2o4 at l65-l69.

Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def.

The Second Circuit “has long adopted an ‘inclusionary’ approach\nto the admission of uncharged crime evidence, under which evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or\nacts is admissible for any purpose other than to shou a defendant’s criminal propensity.” United\nStates v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 2ll, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). Where the\ndefendant claims her conduct has an innocent explanation, the admission of such evidence of other\nacts is particularly appropriate. See, e.g., United States v.

The Evidence is Admissible As Direct Evidence, or in the Alternative, Under Rule\n\n4o4(b)\n\nThe Government’s October ll leter identified seven exhibits and one witness whose\nstatements are admissible as direct evidence, or in the alternative under Rule 4o4(b).

Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle.

GOVERNMENT CONCEDEDLY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE\n\nBASIS OR REASONING TO ADMIT ANY 4o4(B) EVIDENCE\n\nThe government concedes that (i) it was aware of the December 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (Resp. at 34), (ll) those Amendments required it to give notice of the \"permited\npurpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the [4o4(b)] evidence and the reasoning that\nsupports the purpose\" (id.) (\"Notice\"), and (i) the October ll \"Maxwell Rule 4o4 Leter\"\n(\"Leter\") did not identify the \"permited purpose\" under Rule 4o4(b) for which the government\nseeks (alternative) admission of the two categories of evidence, nor the \"reasoning that supports\nthat evidence.\"! The government wholly fails to explain why it could not comply with these\n\"relatively modest\" new Notice requirements on the timeline ordered by this Court. Nouhere in\nresponse does the government seek leave for an extension to provide the appropriate Notice out\nof time nor justify its \"good cause\" for failure to timely comply with both the Court's Order and\nthe Rule. Instead, they assert that \"any alleged gap in the Government's notice is remediated by\nthis brief.\" Resp. at 39-4o. To quote the government's response to Ms. Maxwell's motion in\nlimine, \"to the extent the [government] takes issue with the rule\" requiring specific pre-trial\nNotice under Rule 4o4(b), \"that complaint is properly directed to the drafters of the Federal\nRules of Evidence.\" Resp. at 6l n.l5.\n\nHaving failed to comply with the Notice requirements of the Rule by the (extended)\nCourt ordered deadline of October ll, the government belatedly argues that the tendered\nevidence is either direct evidence or admissible under Rule 4o4(b). They are wrong on both\nfronts.\n\n! Under the misleading and disingenuous sub-heading (2) (\"The Government has Met and\nExceeded its Notice Obligations\"), the government points only to its (i) October ll disclosure of certain\nof the evidence (which gives neither a a proper \"purpose\" or \"reasoning\"), and (i) its Response (the\nrequired \"notice is remediated by this brief\").\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel9of52\n2. The government has apparently abandoned efforts to introduce her\ntestimony as Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nIn their response, the government still fails to comply with the new Rule 4o4(b) notice\nrequirements. First, they do not actually identify the evidence with any specificity, especially\nwith respect to the \"exhibits\" that they hope to introduce through her. Second, while they use the\nwords \"plan and preparation\" or \"knouledge,\" they fail to explain hou those uses of the\ntestimony are independent of the character / propensity inference banned by Rule 4o4(b). Hou\nare the process and frequency of massages or the sexual nature of massages after the period of\nthe conspiracy proof of a plan or preparation, apart from the propensity inference? A plan or\npreparation usually comes before an event. Planning or preparing for something after it has\noccurred can only be based on an assumption that because you are the kind of person who\nsolicits underage massages later, you must have been the kind of person to do so earlier.\nSimilarly, knouledge after the end of the conspiracy is not the same as knouledge at the time of\nor before the purported charged acts occurred, except by way of propensity. Finally, unspecified\nexhibits, many of which appear to have been writen after the conspiracy (e.g., GX 5o5 — dated\nFeb. l4, 2oo5) cannot likewise be proof of the charged crimes which were allegedly completed\nbefore J shoued up.\n\nBecause the government makes no effort to argue the non-propensity purpose for these\nuses Of J Via Rule 4o4(b), and failed to give notice of the purposes or reason in\nadvance in any event, this Court should exclude the evidence on this ground.\n\n3.

As this Court previously has\nruled:\n\n\"To prevail on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\n\n‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence\n\nand jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that\n\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an\n\noffense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y. D’Amelio, 683\n\nF.3d 4l2, 4l6 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729\n\n(Q2d_ Cir. l988)). Because the doctrine of constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7. In contrast to a\n\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the\n\nindictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially\n\ndifferent from those alleged in the indictment.” /d.

Oct. l8, 2ol7).\n\nAs this Court then recognized, the Second Circuit has consistently relied on the same\nstart and end dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial proof did not affect a constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance. See id. (\"The indictment and the evidence at trial contained the same\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy...\") (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n229 (2d.

Dupre, 462 F.3d l3l, l4l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"The\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in the indictment correspond to the conspiracy\nproven at trial...\"). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony — for the post-conspiracy\ntime eric {NN\nWE. Who never met any of the four accusers as far as can be gleaned, and the documents she\nintends to authenticate, run a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will not be the\nsame core evidence charged in the Indictment because it will be based on evidence that post-\ndates the events charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006971.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 458 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT USDC SDNY |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK cise aesicnen:\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: ll/l2/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

See United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).

Cf Fed. R. Evid. 7o4 (“In a criminal case, an expert witness must not\nstate an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that\nconstitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense.”). Those are questions for the jury.\nId. But the very purpose of Dr. Dietz’s testimony on this point is to caution the jury about\nimproperly inferring motive and intent from Dr. Rocchio’s unreliable opinions because, as even\nDr. Rocchio recognized in her testimony, behavior cannot be called “grooming” if it is not in\nfurtherance of “atempted sexual abuse or actual sexual abuse or exploitation.” Ex. 2, p ll8:22-\nl4.\n\nAccordingly, if Dr. Dietz’s opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are reliable—as the\ngovernment does not dispute they are—“Daubert neither requires nor empouers trial courts to\ndetermine which of several competing scientific theories has the best provenance.” Fed. R. Evid.\n7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments (quoting Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola, l6l\nF.3d 77, 85 (lst Cir. l998)). A court must admit competing expert opinions that are reliable and\nrelevant, and then it’s for the jury to decide which expert is correct. /d.

Mot. at\n\nll. The government’s argument misconstrues and misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr. Dietz\ndoes not dispute that vulnerable people can be and are targeted. Ex. l, p 4. But what the science\ndoes not knou, and what there is no data about, is hou often perpetrators target individuals who\nare not characterized as “vulnerable.” /d. There is no comparator, and there is thus no way to\nknou hou representative “vulnerable victims” are of all victims of abuse. /d. As Dr. Dietz will\ntestify, experts do not knou the empirical relationship between vulnerability and abuse. /d.\nAgain, Dr. Dietz should be able to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions by\nexplaining hou they lack scientific support. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments (Rule 7o2 “is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing\nprinciples or methods in the same field of expertise.).\n\nFourth, the government disputes Dr. Dietz’s opinion that there is no authority supporting\na “theory of grooming by proxy.” Mot. at ll-l2.? Once again, though, the government\nmisunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point, and its argument is correspondingly non-responsive. The\ngovernment says, for example, there is “ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship.”\nMot. at l2. Dr. Dietz does not deny this. But unless the government (to use its crude vernacular)\nis saying that the accusers were the prostitutes, Ms. Maxwell was the pimp, and Mr. Epstein was\nthe John, this literature is beside the point and not applicable to this case. Ex. l, p 4.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\n3 To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony on this point, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as described herein. See also supra note\na\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel4 of 28\nflaws alloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and\n\nto compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which none had complete\n\ninformation about his activities.\n\nEx. l, p 7. This testimony is patently relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and intent and to the\nconspiracy counts. If this “compartmentalization” prevented Ms. Maxwell from having the\nrequired knouledge or intent (an ultimate issue for the jury to decide, on which Dr. Dietz will\nnot opine), then she will be not guilty. The government after all intends to ask the Court to\ninstruct the jury on “willful blindness.” The jury should have the benefit of a scientific\nunderstanding of the manner in which a skilled manipulator could have eluded exposure to those\naround him.\n\nThe government obviously disagrees with Dr. Dietz in his evaluation of Mr. Epstein. But\njust because the government has a different view of the facts does not mean Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is inadmissible. Rule 7o2’s emphasis on “sufficient facts or data” does not “authorize\na trial court to exclude an expert’s testimony on the ground” that the government “believes one\nversion of the facts and not the other.” See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments.\n\nThe government’s second objection is easily addressed. The point of the testimony is not\nto suggest jury nullification, which would be improper as defense counsel and Dr. Dietz well\nknou. Mot. at l7. The testimony is relevant, as explained above. In any case, if the Court is\nconcemed about any potential for Dr. Dietz’s testimony to engender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell,\nthe Court can give a limiting instruction. That limiting instruction would be in addition to the\nCourt’s writen instructions, which already will instruct the jury not to decide the case based on\nsympathy or bias. Malletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc., 525 F. Supp. 2d 558, 57l (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo7) (“This Court has routinely relied upon limiting instructions to remind the jury of its role\nand of the limits of expert testimony and clarify the extent of their consideration of such\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page l6 of 28\npatients are telling the truth when they claim to have been abused. See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 5of 24 l7\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl Fourth, the confrontation clause of the Sixth\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantees a criminal defendant the right to\n\n3 meaningful cross-examination of government witnesses at trial.\n4 United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\n5 Indeed, cross-examination is the principal means by which the\n\n6 believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are\n\n7 tested. Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l6, (l974).\n\n8 With this legal framework in mind, and in light of the\n9 parties' extensive briefing on these issues, I think the\n\nlo admissibility of some of the proposed evidence can be\n\nll determined nou, but the admissibility of other evidence will\n\nl2 require additional facts and the context of trial to decide,\n\nl3 but I think it's important for me to give guidance.\n\nl4 Based on the papers before me, I provide the follouing\nl5 guidance: First, the Court will preclude affirmative evidence\nl6 by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\n\nl7 investigation. Although evidence that goes to the thoroughness\nl8 of the government's investigation can in some cases be relevant\nl9 and may in some cases be admissible, it's not relevant or\n2o admissible if not probative of the defendant's guilt of the\n2l crimes charged.\n22 In its briefing, the defense relies heavily on Kyles\n23 v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4 (l995), in which the Supreme Court held\n24 that an informant's statements to police were material for\n25 purposes of Brady disclosures because the statements could be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page2of3\nand Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—\nand not at all on cross-examination. Including the instruction therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general instruction on credibility, Instruction 44. That instruction already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is unavailable to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v. Myerson, l8 F.3d l53, l58 (2d Cir. l994) (collecting cases);\nsee United States v. Romero, 3o4 F. App’x l4, l8 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (summary order) (affirming the\n“equally unavailable” instruction where a witness invoked the protections of the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>); Sand Instr. 6-7 (explaining that the “uncalled witness equally available” instruction\n“includes situations when the witness has indicated that he would assert his Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right\nnot to testify if called”).

That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page4of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. /d. A constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring.

Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-oo33o (AJN) — Unsealing of\nDefendant’s Motion for a New Trial and Questionnaires of Seated\nJurors\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI write on behalf of The New York Times Company (“The Times”) to\nrequest that the Court unseal (a) Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial and\naccompanying brief and exhibits (Dkt. 58o) and (b) the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. These records are subject to\nboth First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those redactions necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 38o F.3d 83, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page2of5\ninfluenced deliberations. See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page3of5\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Right of Access\nAn independent First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong). See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal. (“Press-Enterprise\nIT’), 478 U.S. l, 8-9 (l986); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. Once the right\nataches, it is overcome only by specific, on-the-record findings that\nsealing “is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page4of5\nserve that interest” under the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Bernstein, 8l4 F.3d at\nl43-45; see also Press-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4.\n\nDefendant's Motion for New Trial. Parties’ motions, briefs, and\naccompanying exhibits related to post-trial proceedings have regularly\nbeen found to be subject to the constitutional right of access, especially\nwhen they involve allegations of jury misconduct. See, e.g., United States\nv. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir. l994); United States v. Gonzalez, 927\nF. Supp. 768, 782 (D. Del. l996); see also CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for\nCent. Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d\n833, 84o (2d Cir. l994); United States v. McDade, 929 F. Supp. 8l5, 8l7\nn.4 (E.D. Pa. l996); In re Newsday, Inc., l59 A.D.2d 667, 669 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. l99o). As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer. The documents bear directly on not only “the manner in\nwhich criminal trials are conducted,” the aspect of government of highest\nconcern and importance, Richmond Newspaper, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S.\n555, 575 (l98o), but also specifically voir dire, a central component of a\ncriminal trial—both “to the adversaries [and] to the criminal justice\nsystem,” Press-Enter. Co. vy.

The Defense Motion, as a general mater, contains discussion of some of the relevant\ncase law and information about statements reportedly made by Juror 5o in the news media. There\ncan be no need to hide from public view a discussion of public materials. Moreover, the defense’s\nsuggestion that her defense briefing contains information from some significant investigation into\nJuror 5o is not accurate; the motion does not contain any significant material that is not otherwise\npublic.

Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl.

First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v.

See Dkt. No. 585. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions so the filings can be\ndocketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which\nredactions are approved.\n\nAt the time the briefs are docketed with approved redactions, the Defendant is further\nORDERED to docket Exhibits 2 and 3 to her motion and the exhibit to her reply, and the\nGovernment ORDERED to docket all exhibits to its opposition, all of which are publicly\navailable documents.!\n\nI. Juror 5o Motion to Intervene\n\nThe Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, which both the Government\nand the Defense oppose. Defense Motion, at 5l-52; Government Response, at 44; see also\nDefense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22. The Court denies the motion. Juror 5o cites no authority to support\na juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention.

For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2.

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page /7 of 37\nthem with respect to only one, and only one, criminal statute - New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55. In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she experienced at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a conviction on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for conviction on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l3 of 37\nspecific shouing of prejudice.” /d. at *2o (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou\nthe government proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). Accordingly, the first step in evaluating\nwhether a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> has occurred is for the Court to define the “core of\ncriminality” of the crimes alleged. /d. (cleaned up). It is well setled that “the object of a\nconspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.” /d. (quoting United\nStates v. Roshko, 969 F.2d l, 5 (2d Cir. l992). Moreover, “although an indictment ‘drawn in\ngeneral terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific\nterms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct\nfacts at trial could lead to a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)). For example, specific overt acts alleged in the indictment\nmay narrou the scope of the core of criminality because they “effect the object of the [charged]\nconspiracy.” United States v. Atanasio, 87o F.2d 8o9, 8l6-l7 (2d Cir. l989) (citation omited).\nBy contrast, general factual allegations in an indictment that are not part of the specific statutory\nallegations of a particular count may not limit the core of criminality of that offense.

(cleaned up).\n\nC. The “Core of Criminality” of the Mann Act Counts Was a Scheme to Entice\n\nor Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with an Intent to Violate\nNew York Law.\n\nThere can be no serious dispute that the “core of criminality” of the Mann Act offenses\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment was a scheme by Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they would\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment itself was clear on its\nface. The substantive Mann Act offenses (Counts Two and Four) specifically alleged in the “‘to\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8938\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2l of 37\ncharged offense and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was convicted of a crime\nother than the one alleged in the Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a conspiracy or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially Prejudiced Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law. Tr. 2o48:2o-2o49:l. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating conviction for\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of marijuana distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\ninstruction in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying instruction in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting instruction would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion. Ms. Maxwell\nmaintains her position that the conspiracy counts should be vacated or dismissed for the reasons stated in her other\npost-trial motions set forth in this memorandum.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 25 of 37\nDouble Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> because they subject a person to punishment\nfor a single crime more than once.

Supp. 2d at 3o7 (quoting\n(Braverman v. United States, 3l7 U.S. 49, 53 (l942)). Therefore, “[a] single agreement to\ncommit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy,” but “multiple agreements to commit separate\ncrimes constitute multiple conspiracies.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 57o-\n7l (l989).

Johansen, 56 F.3d 347, 35l (2d\nCir. l995).\n\nWhen an accused is charged with two or more conspiracies in violation of the same\nstatutory provision—in this case, the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l—the Second\nCircuit has adopted a multifactor test for determining whether the conspiracies amount to the\nsame offense for double jeopardy purposes. These factors include:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments;\n(2) the overlap of participants;\n(3) the overlap of time;\n(4) the similarity of operation;\n(5) the existence of common overt acts;\n(6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where\novert acts occurred;\n(7) common objectives; and\n(8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos.

The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe household manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse throughout the relevant time period.

The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a Reasonable\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts.

Juror 5o’s Request to Intervene\nl. Jurors have compelling and legitimate privacy rights.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has explicitly acknouledged that Jurors can have\n“compelling” and “legitimate” privacy interests that warrants sealing the record as to certain\nstatements given by the jurors. Press-Enter. Co. v Superior Ct. of California, Riverside County,\n464 US 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984)-. In Press-Enter. Co., the Supreme Court expressly determined that\nforcing an individual to disclose details of a sexual assault may justify holding closed hearings\nand sealing the record due to “the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very disclosure\nof the episode”. /d. In Press-Enter. Co., Chief Justice Burger further made clear that forced\ndisclosure of past sexual assault suffered by jurors gave rise to a “valid privacy right”. /d.\n\nIn United States v. King, the Second Circuit upheld the ruling by the louer court, which\nalloued parts of the record in that case to be sealed based on the jurors’ privacy interest in\nintensely personal subjects, as well as upheld the louer court’s finding that such interest was\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny King atracted from the press.

RMT Co., 599 F.2d ll83, ll86 (3d Cir. l979) (persons affected by the disclosure\nof allegedly privileged materials may intervene in pending criminal proceedings and seek\nprotective orders). Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case. This is a recognition of\nthe general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or\nnonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one\ncourt has noted, “[e]ven crime victims, who enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have\nno right to intervene in the district court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL\n478o927, at *l (E.D. Wis. 2ol3).\n\nThe second request by Juror 5o is for discovery. Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully\narticulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be\ndenied. For purposes of the issue concerning maintaining the seal on public access, discovery\nrequests are not “judicial documents.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9(S.D.N.Y.\n2ol3) (“experience and logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See\nSEC vy. The Street.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir.2ool) (rejecting claim that deposition\ntestimony became a “judicial document” “because the Court reviewed it in order to decide\nwhether or not to enter [a] protective order’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009009.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 8 of 66\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 for a new\ntrial.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJuror No. 5o says he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child.\nWhen he told his fellou jurors of this abuse during deliberations, “[t]he room went dead\nsilent.” Juror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he drew on his personal\nexperience as a victim to persuade fellou jurors to believe Ms. Maxwell’s accusers,\ndespite the inconsistencies and holes in their stories, even though they delayed disclosing\ntheir allegations against Ms. Maxwell, and in spite of expert testimony from Dr. Elizabeth\nLoftus casting significant doubt on the reliability of their claimed memories.\n\nThis was unfair and prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell, and it all would have been\navoided if Juror No. 5o had told the truth during voir dire.

Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to intervene in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\nintervene for public access. See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to intervene to assert the public’s First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper).

Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973).

This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s discovery request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation.

If he made his false statements intentionally to\nget on the jury, that would mean he had a personal agenda and his bias was even more apparent,\nbut even false statements in the absence of lying would justify striking him for cause. Juror 5o’s\nfalse answers undermined the voir dire process this and other courts follou, including reliance on\nwriten questionnaires, to screen for jurors who, due to their prior experiences, cannot be trusted\nto be fair in the individual case. What happened here is a structural error: “a defendant is ‘entitled\nto be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.’” United States v. Martinez-\nSalazar, 528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6-l7 (2ooo) (quoting Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966)).\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN IMPARTIAL JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an impartial jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly difficult in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\nnecessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (plurality).\n\nHonesty is the heart of the jury-selection process in an adversarial system; indeed, “voir\ndire” means “to speak the truth.” The whole point of the voir dire process is to elicit\ninformation from the venire that may shed light on bias, prejudice, interest in the outcome,\ncompetence, and the like so that counsel and the parties may exercise their judgment\nabout whom to seat and whom to challenge.\n\nFields, 5o3 F.3d at 772. Just as judges must recuse themselves to protect the appearance of\n\nimpartiality, see Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 886 (2oo9), judges must\n\nensure that jurors, as judges of the facts, are also impartial in appearance as well as in reality.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9llo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas. See, e.g., City of Almaty,\nKazakhstan v.

Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen. Juror No. 5o’s\npresence on the jury deprived Ms. Maxwell of the fair and impartial jury the due process and the\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantee. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.! “[T]he seating of any juror who\nshould have been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” United States v. Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548 (l984) and holding that the requirement of a fair and impartial jury is “reflected in\nthe McDonough standard for analyzing allegations that a juror’s false voir dire concealed bias\nthat affected the fairness of the trial: a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias\nmust demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\n\n‘Tt appears that, at best, Ms. Maxwell had lo fair and impartial jurors, not the l2\nguaranteed her by the United States Constitution. We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to trial by an impartial jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page ll of 32\nchildhood sexual abuse; and (3) had he answered the questions accurately he would have been\nchallenged for cause and disqualified.\n\nThe Law\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))). That is not correct.\n\nEveryone accused of a crime is entitled a trial by a fair trial and impartial jury. U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were convicted, in contravention of the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l6 of 32\ntrial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to demonstrate actual bias or, in\nexceptional circumstances, that the facts are such that bias is to be inferred.” McDonough, 464\nU.S. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (citing Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\nThis is the only fair reading of McDonough and Langford, and it is only conclusion the\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> permits. Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S.

The Defendant Was Convicted of the Crimes Charged in the Indictment, So No\nConstructive <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> or Variance Occurred\n\nIn her motion, the defendant claims that the Government’s proof at trial differed from the\n\ncrimes charged in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “S2 Indictment” or “Indictment’’), and\n\nthat the Government therefore constructively amended Counts One, Three, and Four of the\n\nIndictment. Not so. At all times—before trial, in its presentation of the evidence, at closing\n\nargument, and in seeking jury instructions—the Government consistently argued that the\n\n' Unless otherwise noted, case text quotations omit all internal quotation marks, citations, and\nalterations.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9566\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page5of5l\ndefendant enticed and transported Jane to New York with the intent that Jane engage in illegal\nsexual activity, and that the defendant conspired to do so regarding Jane and the other Minor\nVictims. That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance occurred.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page6of5l\ncrime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of hou a defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at\n*2o. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.”\nId. Houever, text in an indictment, such as “factual allegations that do not prove essential\nelements of a charge” and “general factual allegations leading into the statutory allegations” are\nnot limitations on the core of criminality alleged in an indictment. /d.\n\nOnce a court identifies the core of criminality, the court “must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\nconvicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Jd. The Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof,\nprovided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”\nLebedev, 932 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply shou that the facts diverged\ngreatly from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions\ncreated a substantial likelihood that a defendant was convicted for behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l; see United States v. McGinn,\n787 F.3d ll6, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“[T]he proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica\nof the charges contained in an indictment... .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made clear that a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> does not occur where the facts at trial involve not a ‘distinctly different\ncomplex set of uncharged facts’ but ‘a single set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the\nindictment.’” /d. (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l9 (2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\n“Tn contrast to a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, a variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of5l\nfrom those alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l. Reversal due to a\nvariance is appropriate only when the defendant can establish “that substantial prejudice occurred\nat trial as a result of the variance,” a shouing that cannot be made “where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character that could have misled the\ndefendant at trial, and where the variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294. “The\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly held that, so long as a defendant receives notice of the Government’s\ntheory of the case before trial, he is not prejudiced by a variance.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\nra,\nB. Discussion\n\nNo constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance occurred in this case. The grand jury returned the\nS2 Indictment charging the defendant with knouingly transporting Jane with the intent that Jane\nengage in criminal sexual activity in New York, and aiding and abeting the same, and with\nconspiring to entice and transport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York. That is the core of criminality charged in the S2\nIndictment, and it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury\ninstructions.\n\nl. The Proof at Trial and Jury Instructions Captured the Core of Criminality\n\nThe defendant argues that the core of criminality for the Mann Act counts “was a scheme\nby Epstein and [the defendant] to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the\nintent that they would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.” (Def. Mot. at 9).\nThat is precisely the theory the Government advanced at trial. As the defendant correctly states,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof5l\n\nThe Court’s Mann Act jury instructions also permited the jury to determine only whether\nthe defendant had intended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the conspiracy victims were\nintended to engage in sexual activity in New York. During trial, the Court granted defense requests\nfor limiting instructions at the time evidence came in to avoid the precise concern the defendant\nnou articulates. (Tr. ll67-68 (Kate); 2o48-49 (Annie)). See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *27\n(explaining that the Court identified no case “in which the Second Circuit has ever found a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> when a district court issued limiting instructions properly defining the\nscope of the alleged crime”). And at the conclusion of trial, the Court explained that Count Two\nalleged that the defendant “enticed Jane to travel across state lines with the intent that she would\nengage in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the penal law of\nNew York State.” (Tr. 3o34; see Tr. 3o3l (describing the third element of Count Two to require\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). Similarly, the Court\nexplained that Count Four alleged that the defendant knouingly transported Jane “‘with the intent\nthat Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in\nviolation of New York law.” (Tr. 3o37; see Tr. 3o35 (describing the second element of Count\nFour to require proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). For\nboth Counts, the Court specifically instructed the jury on one and only one predicate state offense:\na violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. (Tr. 3o34, 3o37). The instructions on Counts\nOne and Three incorporated this discussion of the elements of Counts Two and Four, and the only\nstatute the Court identified in its discussion of the relevant overt acts was New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. (Tr. 3o49-5o, 3o56-57).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9572\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof5l\n2. There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury Convicted The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and convicted\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat conclusion. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law. The jury was not informed of the age of consent in New Mexico or any\nparticular criminal statute in New Mexico. The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52). Such an instruction would have\nprovided the jury some state law to compare to the facts and determine whether it was violated,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9573\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel2of5l\nof these provide any likelihood, much less a substantial likelihood, that the jury convicted the\ndefendant solely because she intended for Jane to be sexually abused in New Mexico.\na. Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico\n\nJane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,\nthe evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act\ncounts. (Tr. 3l49-5o; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.l (stating that the defense does “not contest that\nalleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]\nconspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knouledge that Epstein was\nhaving sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while\ntraveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating\nthe abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent\nwith the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.\nApp’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l); see Gross, 2o2l WL 4685ll, at *28 (noting that if the jury\ndetermined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different conspiracy, the jury\ninstructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other conspiracy”). Indeed, that\nevidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of\nAnnie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of\nenhancing the risk of conviction based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an\ninstruction, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to\nviolate New York law.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of5l\nconviction outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied\nby a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.\n\nb. The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2lof5l\n“almost invariable assumption of the law . . . that jurors follou their instructions”). Accordingly,\neven if the jury note suggests some confusion, the Court’s response did not constructively amend\nthe S2 Indictment. See Jones, 847 F. App’x at 3o (finding no constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> in a sex\ntrafficking case where the indictment did not contain the verb “advertise” but the evidence included\nevidence of advertising and the Court mistakenly used that verb in parts of the instructions, because\nthe advertising evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and the Court otherwise\ncorrectly instructed the jury); Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“The jury instructions described a\nconspiracy substantially the same as the one charged in the indictment.”).\n\nThird, the defendant’s argument is beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to\nthe jury note or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nargument. See, e.g., United States v. Muraca, 8o3 F. Appx’ 545, 546 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion construing the scope of a jury inquiry and in framing a\nresponse tailored to the inquiry,” and “If a supplemental charge is legally correct, the district court\nenjoys broad discretion in determining hou, and under what circumstances, that charge will be\ngiven.”). Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] essential elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o. The original instructions\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 22 of 5l\ndid not modify any essential element of the offense or permit conviction based on an entirely\ndifferent theory. Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 24 of5l\n\nis all that is required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 622 (2d Cir. 2oo3). And in any\nevent, Jane recalled the incident of abuse at least as early as November 3, 2o2l. (See Def. Mot. at\n5 n.l (citing 35o9-o33 at l)). Notes from that interview were provided to the defense on November\n6, 2o2l—more than three weeks before trial. At the time, the parties were still litigating whether\nKate could testify at all. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 4l7 (order dated November 6, 2o2l, requiring the\nGovernment to brief whether Kate was a “victim” for any legal purpose, including restitution)).\nThe Court did not permit Kate to testify until November l9, 2o2l—almost two weeks after the\ndefendant received the relevant notes. (Dkt. No. 477). And follouing that decision, the parties\ncontinued to litigate the limiting instructions for Kate and Annie in advance of trial. (See, e.g.,\nll/23/2l Tr. at 28-38).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant had ample notice to seek a limiting instruction as to this portion\nof Jane’s testimony. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“rejecting a prejudice argument in part because\n“t]he government disclosed the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). The Court’s\nfailure to give one sua sponte is not a prejudicial variance. The defendant is simply characterizing\nher failure to ask for a limiting instruction at the time of Jane’s testimony as an argument that she\nwas prejudiced. To the contrary, the Court did not err—much less plainly so. See United States\nv. Petit, l9 Cr. 85o (JSR), 2o2l WL 67346l, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2l, 2o2l) (applying the plain\nerror standard to a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> claim in a Rule 33 motion that was not made at trial).\n\nFinally, even if the defendant had been entitled to a limiting instruction but was deprived\nof the opportunity to request it, she still was not prejudiced. As the Court agreed at the charge\nconference, although the Court gave the limiting instructions for Annie and Kate, there was no\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 25of5l\nneed to repeat those instructions in the context of the full charge, which clarified that “the violation\nof law is as charged in New York.” (Tr. 2774-75, 2777). And the fact that the defense failed to\nseek or receive a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony did not provide a separate basis for\nincluding a limiting instruction in the final charge. (Tr. 2777). The Court, the Government, and\nthe defense were painstaking during trial to ensure that the jury understood that the Mann Act\ncounts required an intent to commit a criminal sexual act in New York. That the defense missed\nan additional opportunity for a limiting instruction is not a prejudicial variance, much less a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\nI. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Counts Three and Five\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged three conspiracies under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Counts One and\nThree were predicated on two different provisions of the Mann Act, whereas Count Five charged\na conspiracy based on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. As the Court held in an April l6,\n2o2l Order, the Government was entitled to present these three different counts to the jury. (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 27). Follouing the verdict, houever, the Government agrees that the Court should enter\njudgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the similarities between those\ncounts. Accordingly, of the three conspiracy counts charged in the S2 Indictment, the Government\nsubmits that the Court should enter judgment on Count Three, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2423(a), and Count Five, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nCounts Three and Five are not multiplicitous, and the Court should enter judgment on both\ncounts. In particular, as discussed in greater detail belou, Counts Three and Five arose from\ndifferent criminal schemes, involving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates,\nand a different modus operandi. The defendant ignores these important distinctions, claiming, in\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 26 of5l\nher motion, that these counts are “virtually identical.” (Def. Mot. at 22). But charges that cover\ndifferent schemes under different statutes are not “virtually identical.” The Court should reject\nthis argument.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant has a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United States\nv. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury convicts\non more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” /d. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already been entered\non multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but one\nmultiplicitous count. Id.\n\n“For purposes of a multiplicity analysis, the determinative issue is not whether the same\nconduct underlies separate counts, but whether the offense charged in one count is the same as the\n25\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 34of5l\n\nIt makes no difference, as the defendant argues, that both crimes involved grooming minors\nfor sexual abuse. (Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws. That is\nwhat the S2 Indictment charged, and that is what the Government proved at trial: different\nconspiracy crimes. The Court should deny the motion and enter judgment on Counts Three and\nFive.\n\nIll. The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her Conviction and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper Pre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her conviction and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo). Her arguments fare no beter post-trial.\n\nThe defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. First, the defendant has not established that any alleged pre-\nindictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense.

Nos.\nll-3oo5/2o-3429, Jan. lo, 2o22) (granting habeas relief as to juror bias claim because it\nis “possible for Cunningham to prove that [the juror] was actually biased without relying\non juror testimony in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b)”); compare Pena-\nRodriguez v. Colorado, l37 S. Ct. 855 (2ol7) (“Where a juror makes a clear statement\nindicating that he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal\ndefendant, the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order\nto permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror's statement and any resulting\ndenial of the jury trial guarantee.”). Without relying on juror testimony, it is already clear\nthat Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer the questionnaire; Juror No. 5o has publicly\nadmited he is a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse.\n\nAs for identifying the other juror who was also a victim of sexual assault and\nabuse, the Court and parties can identify the juror without eliciting testimony about what\nwas said during deliberations. The remaining eleven jurors can be asked, under oath,\nwhether their answer to question 48 is correct and whether they have been a victim of\nsexual assault or abuse. Presumably the second juror will self-identify.\n\nIl. Juror No. 5o has no right to intervene.\nA. Juror No. 5o lacks standing.\n\nJuror No. 5o seeks to intervene suggesting that “it is indisputable that precedent\nsupports intervention by interested third parties in criminal maters....”” Memo. at 8. This\nclaim is not supported by “the long line of precedent hold[ing] that a non-party lacks a\njudicially cognizable interest in a defendant’s prosecution.” United States v. Stoerr, 695\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo975o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 59 of 66\nF.3d 27l, 278 (3d Cir. 2ol2). Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to intervene in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\nintervene for public access. See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to intervene to assert the public’s First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent. See United States\nv. RMI Co., 599 F.2d ll83, ll86 (3d Cir. l979) (persons affected by the disclosure of\nallegedly privileged materials may intervene in pending criminal proceedings and seek\nprotective orders). Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one court has noted, “[e]ven crime victims,\nwho enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have no right to intervene in the\ndistrict court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL 478o927, at *l (E.D.\nWis. 2ol3).\n\nB. This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s discovery request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation. Once he was thoroughly tipped off by the government, Juror No. 5o has\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo975l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas. See, e.g., City of Almaty,\nKazakhstan v. Ablyazov, No. l:l5 Civ. o5345 (AJN) (KHP), 2o2o WL ll3o67o, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9844\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page6of 32\n\nGhislaine Maxwell submits this reply in support of her motion under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 for a new trial.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMs. Maxwell “was entitled to be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, impartial and unprejudiced\njurors.” Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen. Juror No. 5o’s\npresence on the jury deprived Ms. Maxwell of the fair and impartial jury the due process and the\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantee. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.! “[T]he seating of any juror who\nshould have been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” United States v. Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548 (l984) and holding that the requirement of a fair and impartial jury is “reflected in\nthe McDonough standard for analyzing allegations that a juror’s false voir dire concealed bias\nthat affected the fairness of the trial: a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias\nmust demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\n\n‘Tt appears that, at best, Ms. Maxwell had lo fair and impartial jurors, not the l2\nguaranteed her by the United States Constitution. We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to trial by an impartial jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page ll of 32\nchildhood sexual abuse; and (3) had he answered the questions accurately he would have been\nchallenged for cause and disqualified.\n\nThe Law\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))). That is not correct.\n\nEveryone accused of a crime is entitled a trial by a fair trial and impartial jury. U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were convicted, in contravention of the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l6 of 32\ntrial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to demonstrate actual bias or, in\nexceptional circumstances, that the facts are such that bias is to be inferred.” McDonough, 464\nU.S. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (citing Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\nThis is the only fair reading of McDonough and Langford, and it is only conclusion the\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> permits. Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 32\ncommunications on Twiter and Instagram shortly after trial. Juror No. 5o deliberately mis-\nstated the date of his closing of his Twiter account and therefore Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\ndiscovery in order to prove that deliberate falsehood.\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights and constituted structural, reversible error. This Court should vacate the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page /7 of 24\nindicating that it is confused, “[i]t is the responsibility of the trial judge to provide the jury with\nsufficient instruction to enable it to assess the evidence within the proper legal framework and to\nreach a rational verdict”). The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it concluded that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of24\na result, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the crime charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to muddy the common sense reading of the Jury\nNote by focusing on peripheral or irrelevant issues, or by mischaracterizing the text of the Note,\nor even by inserting words, phrases, and punctuation that are not contained in the Note, in an\neffort to confuse and complicate the analysis. (Opp. at l5-l7). This is nothing more than\nmisdirection and should be rejected.\n\nFor example, the government asserts that Jane’s testimony concerning the New Mexico\nconduct was proper and relevant to the jury’s consideration of the Mann Act counts, and that the\njury “could have convicted even if no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it\nconcluded that the defendant intended for abuse to occur in New York.” (Opp. at ll-l2\n(emphasis in original)). The Court itself raised this same point in declining to give the jury the\nrequested supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l49-5o). Ms. Maxwell does not dispute either\nassertion. But that is not the issue raised by the Jury Note. In fact, the Jury Note makes clear\nthat the jury was considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without concluding that she\nintended for Jane to be abused in New York. The question posed in the Jury Note was whether\nMs. Maxwell could “be found guilty” under the second element of Count Four (to use the jury’s\noun words) if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\nin New Mexico. (Court Exhibit #l5). In other words, the jury was asking whether they could\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on that intent, and that intent alone. The answer to\nthat question is no, and the jury should have been so instructed to prevent a constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 24\n\nThe government further argues that the Jury Note is ambiguous because it is not clear\nwhich flights it refers to or where the jury believed the sexual activity occurred. (Opp. at l5-l6).\nThe first point is irrelevant and the second is based on a disingenuous reading of the Jury Note.\nAs to the flights, it is true that one of the jury’s questions was whether it was sufficient to convict\nunder Count Four if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell assisted with Jane’s return trip from New\nMexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. But the problem raised by the Jury Note had nothing\nto do with the specific flights the jury may have been referring to, or whether Jane was on those\nflights, or whether those flights may have gone to New York. The problem raised by the Jury\nNote related to the jury’s other question about Ms. Maxwell’s intent. The jury was asking\nwhether they could convict on Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane\nto engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. That was the question that raised the potential for a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. And contrary to the government’s assertion, the Jury Note was crystal\nclear about where the jury believed the sexual activity occurred: New Mexico. See Court Exhibit\n#l5 (“... the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\n...” (emphasis added)).”\n\nFinally, the government atempts to cast further doubt on the clear meaning of the Jury\nNote by altering its text. The government posits that the jury was asking whether Ms. Maxwell\ncould be found guilty based “in part” on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico. (Opp. at l6).\nThat is simply not what the Jury Note says. The jury could have easily asked that very question:\n“Can Ms. Maxwell be found guilty on Count Four based in part on Jane’s testimony about sexual\nabuse in New Mexico?” In fact, as the government points out, the jury had previously sent a\n2 We note that the government inserted a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if,” which does not exist in the\nJury Note. Compare Opp. at l3 (“... New Mexico, where/if ...”) with Court Exhibit #l5 (“... New Mexico where/if\n...”). The absence of a comma is significant to the analysis because it clarifies that the jury was focused on New\nMexico as the place where Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagellof 24\nnote asking a similar question about Annie Farmer’s testimony. See Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can we\nconsider Annie’s testimony as conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But\nthe Jury Note did not say that, nor did it contain the phrase “in part.” Instead, the Jury Note\nasked a much more specific question about whether the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four if it found that she (l) intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico\nand (2) aided with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. The\ngovernment’s speculation about what the jury may have meant cannot alter the clear text and\nmeaning of the Jury Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the intent\nrequirement necessary for Count Four and needed to be given a supplemental instruction to\nremedy the confusion.?\n\nB. The Court Erred When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental\n\nInstruction Clarifying the Intent Requirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court further erred when it declined to give the jury a supplemental instruction, as\nrequested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement for Count Four — namely, that the\ngovernment had to prove that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. The Jury Note shoued not only that the jury had a mistaken understanding of the law\nconcerming intent, but also indicated that the jury might convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. At that point, it was the\nresponsibility of the Court to give the jury a supplemental instruction “to enable it to assess the\nevidence within the proper legal framework and to reach a rational verdict” and to avoid a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the charges. Parker, 9o3 F.2d at lol; see also Gross, 2ol7 WL\n3 The government chides the defense for engaging in speculation about what the jury may have been thinking before\nsending the Jury Note. (Opp. l7-l9). The defense engaged in that discussion to explain why the proof at trial may\nhave led the jury to focus on Jane’s testimony about the conduct in New Mexico with respect to Count Four. But the\nCourt need not rely on that analysis. The Jury Note speaks for itself. The jury was focused on Jane’s abuse in New\nMexico and misunderstood the intent requirement necessary to convict under Count Four.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 24\n4685ll, at *23 (“[T]he Second Circuit has emphasized the pouer of limiting instructions to\nprevent constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>[.]” (emphasis in original)). By declining to provide a\nsupplemental instruction, the Court created “a substantial likelihood” that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of crimes “distinctly different” from the ones alleged. Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\n*2l; see also Millstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to\nbroaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the\nindictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government argues that any confusion the jury may have had on the issue of intent\nwas ameliorated by the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the existing instruction on the second\nelement of Count Four. (Opp. at l9). According to that instruction, the government had to prove\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law” and further specified that the\nrelevant criminal offense was a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. (Instr. No.\n2l). The government contends that the jury could not have misunderstood the instruction\nbecause it did not mention New Mexico at all and only mentioned an intent to engage in sexual\nactivity that violated New York law. (Opp. at l9-2o).\n\nThe government’s confidence, houever, is belied by the Jury Note, which indicates that\nthe jury thought it could potentially convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four if it found that she\nintended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. And it is not hard to see where\nthis confusion came from. Although the jury instructions state that the jury needed to find that\nMs. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” nouhere in the jury instructions does it\nstate that a violation of New York law, or specifically a violation of Section l3o.55, must occur\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 24\nthat Epstein gave her money after “almost every visit” to his home in Palm Beach.

(Tr. 3o8-ll; 2o83-86).\n\nThe government’s atempt to characterize Count Three as an “earlier scheme” and Count\nFive as a “later pyramid scheme” with different objects and methods is unavailing. (Opp. at 32).\nThe government’s theory, as presented to the jury, was that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell engaged in\na single conspiracy with a common method of operation and objective: to recruit and “groom”\nunderage girls to sexually abuse them. That theory was entirely consistent with the evidence at\ntrial. For these reasons, Counts Three and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment\nonly on Count Three.\n\nIi.

Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse.

App’x 89, 9l (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl.

For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s Grand Jury Clause, “‘a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6, 4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and variance may appear ‘merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary circumstances, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.”\nUnited States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n* The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt. D Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9; see also\nUnited States v. Jones, 847 F. App’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order) (no constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> in sex trafficking case where indictment did not allege “advertising” but the\nevidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” (cleaned up)).\n\nThird, the Government’s summation also reflected the core of criminality of transporting\nJane and other underage girls to New York with the intention that sexual activity would occur in\nNew York. In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2. The jury note and the Court’s response did not result in a\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury convicted the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York. See\nMaxwell Reply at 2. She argues that the Court then erred by refusing a supplemental instruction.\nThe ambiguous note and the Court’s rejection of the Defendant’s proposed responses to it did not\n5 In its summation regarding Count Two, which introduced the New York predicate offense to the jury, the\nGovernment also repeatedly emphasized that the Defendant and Epstein enticed Jane to travel to New York to be\nabused.

No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here.

See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 8 of 29\n\nIn each of these cases, the ex post facto violation resulted from an increase in the\napplicable statutory penalty, as opposed to the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines.\nHouever, the Supreme Court has clearly held that it is also a violation of the Ex Post Facto\nClause to apply a later version of the Guidelines that increases the recommended sentencing\nrange if the criminal conduct was complete before the later version took effect. See Peugh, 569\nU.S. at 532-33 (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is sentenced under\nGuidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new version provides a\nhigher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the\noffense.”). An ex post facto violation is an ex post facto violation regardless of whether the\nincreased penalty resulted from a change in the statute or a change in the Guidelines. Hence, if\nthe end date of the offense conduct dictates whether it is permissible to apply a later Guidelines\nbook consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the jury must find that fact.\n\nHere, the S2 Indictment alleges only that the criminal conduct ended “in or about 2oo4”\nand does not specify whether the conduct continued into November and December 2oo4. Nor\nwas the jury asked to make a specific finding as to the end date of the offense conduct. Because\nthe jury did not make the necessary factual finding, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4 Guidelines\nand must instead apply the 2oo3 Guidelines.°\n\nB. The Trial Record Is Insufficient to Support a Finding that the Offense\n\nConduct Continued Past November l, 2oo4.\n\nEven if the Court can determine the end date of the offense conduct for Guidelines\n\npurposes, the record does not support a finding that the conduct extended past November l,\n3 Although the issue is properly framed as an ex post facto issue, it would also violate Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights for the Court, and not the jury, to determine when the offense conduct ended.

As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator....

Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-oo33o (AJN) — Unsealing of\nDefendant’s Motion for a New Trial and Questionnaires of Seated\nJurors\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI write on behalf of The New York Times Company (“The Times”) to\nrequest that the Court unseal (a) Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial and\naccompanying brief and exhibits (Dkt. 58o) and (b) the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. These records are subject to\nboth First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those redactions necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v.

See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010756.jpg": "Castat2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncureiSs3 AleiOaW2522 Reape Babifh353\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> Right of Access\nAn independent First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong). See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal. (“Press-Enterprise\nIT’), 478 U.S. l, 8-9 (l986); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. Once the right\nataches, it is overcome only by specific, on-the-record findings that\nsealing “is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo756\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010757.jpg": "Castatf2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncureatSs3 AleiOaW2522 Rrapped4cifh353\nserve that interest” under the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Bernstein, 8l4 F.3d at\nl43-45; see also Press-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4.\n\nDefendant's Motion for New Trial. Parties’ motions, briefs, and\naccompanying exhibits related to post-trial proceedings have regularly\nbeen found to be subject to the constitutional right of access, especially\nwhen they involve allegations of jury misconduct. See, e.g., United States\nv. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir. l994); United States v. Gonzalez, 927\nF. Supp. 768, 782 (D. Del. l996); see also CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for\nCent. Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d\n833, 84o (2d Cir. l994); United States v. McDade, 929 F. Supp. 8l5, 8l7\nn.4 (E.D. Pa. l996); In re Newsday, Inc., l59 A.D.2d 667, 669 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. l99o). As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer. The documents bear directly on not only “the manner in\nwhich criminal trials are conducted,” the aspect of government of highest\nconcern and importance, Richmond Newspaper, Inc. v.

A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\ncall Eva, Michelle, and Kelly, who will deny being involved in the group sexualized massages,\nwhich are the basis of the charges in this case, and will do anything but “back up” or “confirm”\nwhat Jane has alleged.\n\nThese are not “collateral” issues. As the Notes to Rule 6o8 make clear, the bar on\n“extrinsic evidence applies only when the sole reason for proffering that evidence is to atack or\nsupport the witness’ character for truthfulness.” Fed.

Here, Eva, Michelle, and Kelly’s testimony is not being offered to atack\nJane’s “character for truthfulness.” To the contrary, it is being offered to shou that the\nsexualized massages did not happen.\n\nJane has claimed that Eva, Michelle, and Kelly are essentially eyewitnesses to the abuse\nshe allegedly suffered at the hands of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. Eva, Michelle, and Kelly\nwill deny that. The testimony of an “eyewitness” to the very conduct alleged to be criminal is not\na “collateral issue.”\n\nRule 6o8 bars “extrinsic evidence only if the sole purpose for offering the evidence was\nto prove the witness’ character for veracity.” Jd.

The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o. Second,\nlegislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 6o.\nThird, a case-specific approach would not produce practical difficulties or potential\nunfairness.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to\nconclude that the PROTECT Act’s <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to § 3283 applies to\nMaxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.\n\n24 In re Enter. Mortg.

Maxwell, she stated, had “directly[,] repeatedly, and over the course of many\nyears participated in a horrific scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some as\nyoung as l4, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.” /d. at 89. As an example, she noted,\nafter Carolyn had confided in Maxwell her personal history of having been raped and molested\nby her grandfather starting at a very young age, Maxwell used that knouledge to continue the\n“cycle of sexual abuse,” inducing Carolyn to give Epstein “sexualized massages” for “years,”\nand by herself touching Carolyn’s breasts when Carolyn was l4 years old. /d. at 9o-9l.

It upheld\nJudge Nathan’s (l) holding that a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution in this\nDistrict; (2) holding that the S2 Indictment had been timely filed; (3) denial of Maxwell’s Rule\n33 motion based on juror misconduct; (4) response to a jury note, which Maxwell had argued\nresulted in a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of or prejudicial variance from the S2 Indictment; and (5)\nsentence as procedurally reasonable. United States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256, 27o (2d Cir.\n4 Judge Nathan also sentenced Maxwell to a post-imprisonment term of five years’ supervised\nrelease and to pay a $75o,ooo fine (the maximum allouable).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2o of 3l\nby State Department official Alger Hiss); see also note l2, supra (citing similar D.D.C. cases).\nNone of these cases involved the secondhand, summary-witness testimony of law enforcement\nagents. None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3 of l97 2544\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl asserting a Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege, I'm not sure whether\n\n2 that -—-\n\n3 THE COURT: I don't have a pleading, I have --\n\n4 MS.

So I'm not sure hou to think of that.\n6 It's certainly true that, if someone invokes, the defense can't\n7 offer immunity the way that the government can. That's true in\n8 every case.

And I won't name names if we don't want to do that.\nl9 But I think we probably knou who we're talking about here. And\n2o that is, you knou, had we tried to call that witness or those\n2l witnesses, they undoubtedly would have invoked their Fifth\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights.

Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and\nfairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing\norder of July 23, 2o2o. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal\ndefendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nCounsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an\nofficer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because\nit is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil\nproceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order\nof the Court.” Protective Order, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) at {¥ l(a), l8 (Exhibit A). As required by\nthat Protective Order and Judge Nathan’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel\ninitiated a conferral with the U.S. Atorney’s Office over the weekend concerning a\nmodification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second\nCircuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order\nin the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with\nthis Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under\nseal if necessary).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool932l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019354.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel2 of 24\n\nl4.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nApp.o3l\nDOJ-OGR-oool949o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019555.jpg": "CGsedl ZD ae SBos Aden (hdc WHE 2o2 F iB 68h /Pag eatyei2i ab4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019569.jpg": "Came POBOROOBBoANeht DOCOURBATA o Fed DS3o2 Rag eh age’ iS\nThe Honorable Alison J.

LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2))). Among other things, the stay\nvindicates the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil\ncase and then “conforming” their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the\ncivil case. This concern is all the more real when\nee\nee\na —CsSCSC‘\na\nMs. Maxwell further anticipates the very immediate need to disclose the Materials to\nee\nee\nnn —“‘SsSCSCs\n|\nNotably, the Material at issue is not accuser-related or sensitive in any regard.

Given that the\nMaterial has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court’s\nOrder, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this\nCourt has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court’s Protective\nOrder. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues\nrelated to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion “that neither it\nnor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or\npermissible in civil cases.” Doc. # 33 at 7.

That is\nnot so.\n\nIn the civil appeal, Ms. Maxwell is not asking this Court to rule on the\npropriety of the government’s conduct in circumventing Martindell. Rather, Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument in the civil appeal is that, unless this Court reverses Judge\nPreska’s order unsealing the deposition material, Ms. Maxwell may never be able to\nchallenge before Judge Nathan the government’s conduct in obtaining her\ndepositions. As Ms. Maxwell said in her opening brief in the appeal of Judge\nPreska’s unsealing order:\n\nThe civil case is not the appropriate forum to litigate the\n\ngovernment’s apparent violation of Martindell. Ms. Maxwell intends\n\nto make that argument to Judge Nathan in the criminal case. But if\n\nJudge Preska’s unsealing order is affirmed and Ms. Maxwell’s\n\ndeposition is released, her ability to make that argument before Judge\n\nNathan will be prejudiced.

If\nMaxwell is concerned that unsealing will open up an\ninevitable discovery argument for the Government,\nshe can explain to Judge Nathan when making a sup-\npression motion hou an unsealing decision would have\nbeen altered by revelation of criminal discovery mate-\nrials to the unsealing court.‘ If Maxwell is dissatisfied\nwith the result of that suppression motion, she can\nraise the issue on appeal follouing final judgement. In\nshort, because Judge Nathan’s Order is not effectively\nunreviewable on appeal after final judgment, Maxwell\ncannot satisfy the third prong of the collateral order\ndoctrine. ®\n\n4 Notably, though, Maxwell has not explained\nhou her desire to prevent the Government from mak-\ning an inevitable discovery argument has any bearing\non Judge Preska’s analysis of whether the First\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires unsealing of judicial documents\nin a civil case. She offers no case law to support such\nan argument and does not articulate hou her desire to\nprevent the Government from making an inevitable\ndiscovery argument impacts the unsealing analysis in\na civil case.\n\n5 In support of her argument in favor of expand-\ning the collateral order doctrine to embrace her inter-\nlocutory appeal here, Maxwell suggests that this ap-\npeal has not and will not delay the criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool963l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019632.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page25 of 37\nl9\n\nMaxwell nevertheless argues that reversal of the\nOrder is necessary to prevent documents in a civil case\nfrom being unsealed.

As\nsuch, she has not shoun hou the Order damages her\nin any way. See Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 26 (without a\nshouing of serious harm, “review cannot be granted\nunder section l292(a)(l)”).6\n(Br. l4). That remains to be seen. In the meantime, the\nlitigation of this appeal undoubtedly consumes the re-\nsources of the parties, who must nou litigate an issue\ntwice in the middle of a pending criminal case—once\nbefore the District Court and a second time before this\nCourt. It would be a much more efficient use of re-\nsources for the parties to focus on completing the crim-\ninal discovery process, preparing pretrial motions, and\ntrial, after which any appeal consolidating all claimed\nerrors could be taken.\n\n6 As noted in the Government’s Motion to Dis-\nmiss, 28 U.S.C. § l292(a)(l) provides that Courts of\nAppeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory\norders of the district courts of the United States ... or\nof the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying,\nrefusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dis-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019637.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3o of 37\n24\ndoes not suggest that Judge Nathan commited legal\nerror when issuing the Order denying her motion.\n\nSecond, Judge Nathan did not abuse her discretion\nwhen determining that Maxwell had offered no basis\nfor determining that good cause justified a modifica-\ntion of the Protective Order. In her briefing before the\nDistrict Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explana-\ntion of hou the criminal discovery materials could\nhave any conceivable impact on the issues pending in\ncivil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that,\nfor example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery\nargument by the Government should foreclose unseal-\ning in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be\naffected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a sep-\narate criminal case. In the absence of any such expla-\nnation, Judge Nathan’s Order declining to modify the\nProtective Order did not amount to an abuse of her\nbroad discretion when overseeing an ongoing criminal\ncase.\n\nEven on this appeal, Maxwell still fails to explain\nwhy she needs to use materials relating to the Govern-\nment’s applications seeking the modification of certain\nprotective orders in other judicial proceedings. As far\nas the Government is aware, the only issue pending in\nthe civil litigation in which Maxwell seeks to use those\ncriminal discovery materials involves whether the\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> requires that certain filings in those\ncases be made available on the public docket. Maxwell\ncannot explain why certain criminal discovery materi-\nals are relevant to the issues pending in those cases or\nhou the manner in which the Government obtained\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain discovery materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal discovery materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law. (Br. 27). Maxwell claims\nthat “all [she] seeks in this appeal is the ability to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019651.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Paged of 23\non the civil protective order’s guarantee of confidentiality in declining to invoke\nher Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to remain silent.\n\nInstead of fairly addressing these arguments, houever, the government\nretreats to the claim that Ms. Maxwell “does not articulate” or “does not explain”\nwhy Judge Preska and this Court need to knou i\nIS 4o5.82l5 o.4 &\n27.

Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool987o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019920.jpg": "CaSade2ZOter) d3GouAunnt Bib eutre/otl 22o 2Ftil e@ OFAL8) 26a deadect 2 Gf l9\n\nat *l (S.D.N.Y.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues\n\nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her\n\nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial\nmotions nou before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.\nMs. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of\ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b).

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

Dkt.\nNo. 2o7. The Court will try the non—perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its\nOpinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See\nDkt. Nos. l33, l39. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government\nobtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her\nrights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self—incrimination, and to\ndue process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order. The Court requires information from the\nGovernment for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the\nCourt by leter docketed on ECF no later than April 2o, 2o2l, whether it intends to use\nany of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the\nnon—perjury counts in this case.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed\norder regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November l8,\n2o2l. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

Dkt.\nNo. 2o7. The Court will try the non—perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its\nOpinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See\nDkt. Nos. l33, l39. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government\nobtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her\nrights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self—incrimination, and to\ndue process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order. The Court requires information from the\nGovernment for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the\nCourt by leter docketed on ECF no later than April 2o, 2o2l, whether it intends to use\nany of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the\nnon—perjury counts in this case. If the Government does not intend to use any of the\ndocuments subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the non—perjury\ncounts, the Court will defer consideration of those motions until it has scheduled the\ntrial of the perjury counts.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

(Comey,\nMaurene) (Entered: ll/l2/2o2l)\n\nll/l2/2o2l | 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nmotion seeking clarification on two items from the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed\norder regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November l8,\n2o2l. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

She filed the briefs, along with the corresponding exhibits, temporarily\nunder seal in order to permit the Government and the Court to review certain proposed\nredactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, ll, and l2 did not\ncontain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs l, 3, 5, 6, and lo contain limited\nproposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and lo also contain exhibits that the Defendant\nproposes be filed under seal. As set forth in the Defendant's cover leter, the premise of\nthe proposed redactions is that the materials were produced in discovery and subject to\nthe protective order that has been entered in this case. The mere existence of a\nconfidentiality agreement or a protective order covering judicial documents is insufficient\nto overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi Nissay Doua Ins. Co. v.

And the Court did not receive specific requests or justifications to redact or\nseal any of the materials. The Defendant is ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8,\n9, ll, and l2 on ECF today, as she did not propose any redactions to these and the\nGovernment has not voiced any opposition to these being filed without redactions. If\neither side is seeking these or any other redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they\nmust file a leter indicating the redactions they request and providing specific\njustifications for the sealing requests or redactions, in line with the principles set forth in\nLugosch. By April 2o, 2o2l, the parties shall confer and submit a leter informing the\nCourt whether any redactions are being sought. If no redactions are being sought, the\nDefendant is ORDERED to docket the remaining reply briefs on ECF by April 2o, 2o2l.\n(Signed by Judge Alison J.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The Government filed\na first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which contained only small,\nministerial corrections.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> (Dkt.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination.

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the Defense\nindicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The Government is\naccordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January 28, 2o22,\nindicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this witness.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.\n58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification\nleter on or before February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new\ntrial motion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this\ncase, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense\nthe opportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,\nwhich is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are proposed, the\nDefense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22, and the\nGovernment leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are FURTHER\nORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for\nsentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.\nSO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

There is no question that they did. The Court thus\nconcludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the\nPROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to\nher alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in\nWeingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the\nview Maxwell nou takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions\nof at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773\nF.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir.\n2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal\nstatute applies to past conduct. See Landgrafv. UST Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994).\nCourts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct,\ncourts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past\nconduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Jd.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To assess a statute’s meaning here, courts\nmust consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including\nthe statute’s history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter.\nMortg. Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nIs\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel55 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020774.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel56 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020784.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel66 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25 of 34\ncounsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the\nMann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party’s atorney\npresents serious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73,\nl78 (2d Cir. 2oo9). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun credibility, jurors might\nperceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between\nargument and evidence might confuse the jury. /d. Disqualification of counsel also implicates\nMaxwell’s Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWE), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the atorneys who\nrepresented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with\nthe facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o-7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v.

That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported.\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” $2 Ind. | 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o85l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020852.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page26 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. /d. A constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020954.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel28 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page ll of 4o\nwas impossible he would be selected as a final juror. /d. at ll-l3, l8. He testified that his\npersonal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not\ncrossed his mind as he filled out the questionnaire.\n\nThe Court asked follou-up questions consistent with those asked of prospective jurors\nduring voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires,\nincluding those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial. Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt.

Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020988.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel62 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 5 of 45\nA. Applicable law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> guarantees that no person shall “be\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend.

Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v.

Yet “whether the evidence shous a single conspiracy or more than one\nconspiracy is often not determinable as a mater of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”\nJones, 482 F.3d at 72.

United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v.

The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6,4l9.

Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Hrank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> and variance may appear “merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance ls not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v.

No constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n4 The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same.

In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2. Thejury note and the Court’s response did not result ina\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury convicted the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York. See\nMaxwell Reply at 2. She argues that the Court then erred by refusing a supplemental instruction.\nThe ambiguous note and the Court’s rejection of the Defendant’s proposed responses to it did not\n5 In its summation regarding Count Two, which introduced the New York predicate offense to the jury, the\nGovernment also repeatedly emphasized that the Defendant and Epstein enticed Jane to travel to New York to be\nabused.

No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021016.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel9o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2-l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021018.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel92 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here.

See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and.\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7.

Dodge, 597 F.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo).\nDodge, houever, had nothing to do with § 3283. Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a completely different\nstatute passed years after the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to § 3283. Worse still, the full\nquote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s fext, not its legislative history.\nSee Dodge, 597 F.3d at l355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our\nconclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against\nchildren as possible.”) (emphasis added). Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by\nextension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative\nhistory for § 3283 that does not exist.

U.S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7). The\nDistrict Court conceded, as it had to, that Weingarten is not controlling (Al47), but\nit essentially and erroneously treated Weingarten as though it were. The only\nquestion in Weingarten was whether the petitioner’s trial counsel provided\nconstitutionally deficient representation by conceding that an indictment charging\nMann Act violations was timely. See 865 F.3d at 52. The petitioner contended\nthat his trial counsel should have argued that § 3283 must be interpreted under a\ncategorical standard. See id. at 58. This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021114.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page67 of ll3\n\nthe sexual abuse of a child.

In addition, $3299 cannot be applied retroactively. In 2oo6,\nCongress enacted §3299 to eliminate the limitations period for §l59l.

Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021339.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AGS 3536o38, Pagel67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\n<span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nI. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Enumerated Rights\nThe CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as ‘“‘a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”\nInitially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime\nvictims the follouing eight rights:\n(l) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public\ncourt proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or\nof any release or escape of the accused.\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court\nproceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be\nmaterially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\nproceeding.\n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the\ndistrict court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole\nproceeding.\n(5) The reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case.\n265 See l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o). The relevant text of the VRRA\nis set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section l.B of this Report.\n264 l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). Although nine congressional hearings were held between l996 and\n2oo3 concerning amending the Constitution to address victims’ rights, neither chamber of Congress voted on\nlegislation proposing an <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), GAO-o9-54, Report\nto Congressional Commitees: Crime Victims’ Rights Act — Increasing Awareness, Modifving the Complaint Process\nand Enhancing Compliance Monitoring Will Improve Implementation of the Act at l6 (Dec. 2oo8) (GAO CVRA\nAwareness Report).\n285 The relevant text of the CVRA is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section I.A of this Report.\nl9l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l39l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021428.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page256 of 258\nSA-254\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span> rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021446.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o39, Pagel6 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.3°’\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”*88 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**° The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.4°° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*°! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”°”? The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe | and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\n388 The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal\nSystem to the USAO on January lo, 2o2o.\n22o See In re Wild, No. l9-l3843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3) (Sept. 3o, 2ol9).\n39l Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime\nVictims Rights Act at l4 (Oct. 3l, 2ol9). As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021501.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 395 3536o39, Page/l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 325 of 348\n\n3.

USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244\n(l994), the Supreme Court set forth a two-part frame-\nwork for determining whether a statute may be ap-\nplied retroactively. At the first step, “if Congress ex-\npressly prescribed that a statute applies retroactively\nto antecedent conduct, the inquiry ends and the court\nenforces the statute as it is writen, save for constitu-\ntional concerns.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55. If,\nhouever, the “statute is ambiguous or contains no ex-\npress command regarding retroactivity,” then the\ncourt must turn to the second step, where “a reviewing\ncourt must determine whether applying the statute to\nantecedent conduct would create presumptively im-\npermissible retroactive effects.” Jd. at 55. “If it would,\nthen the court shall not apply the statute retroactively\nabsent clear congressional intent to the contrary.” Id.\n“If it would not, then the court shall apply the statute\nto antecedent conduct.” Id.\nB.

Moreover, un-\nder the Landgraf framework, the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nproperly applies to pre-enactment criminal conduct\nthat still could have been timely prosecuted at the time\nof the enactment, as was the case here.\na. There Was No Retroactivity as to\nCounts Three and Six\n\nAs an initial mater, Counts Three and Six both\ncharged conduct that continued through 2oo4, l.e., af-\nter the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to Section 3288, and thus pre-\nsent no retroactivity concerns.\n\nFor conspiracy charges requiring proof of an overt\nact, including l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the conspiracy statute\nat issue here, “[t]he statute of limitations runs from\nthe date of the last overt act in furtherance of the con-\nspiracy.” United States v.

Similarly, for a continuing\nsubstantive offense, the statute of limitations only\n“begin[s] to run when the crime is complete,” meaning\nwhen “the conduct has run its course.” United States\nv. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 46 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nHere, the Indictment alleged that the conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three and the sex trafficking offense\ncharged in Count Six continued through 2oo4. (A.l27,\nl32; see also A.l23-24, l3l-32 (describing conduct\nthrough 2oo4 involving Victim-4)).7 Thus, the statute\n\n7 To the extent Maxwell’s argument challenges\nthe sufficiency of the evidence rather than the denial\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021693.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page46 of 93\n3o\nof limitations for these two counts did not begin to run\nuntil 2oo4, well after Congress enacted the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to Section 3283.

Landgraf Step One\n\nAt step one of the Landgraf analysis, the question\nis whether Congress has “expressly prescribed the\nstatute’s proper reach.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o.\nWhen evaluating Congress’s intent at step one, this\nof the motions to dismiss, see United States v.\nRutigliano, 79o F.3d 389, 4oo (2d Cir. 2ol5), the evi-\ndence at trial established that Carolyn continued to\nvisit Epstein’s residence through 2oo4.

In re Enter. Mort. Acceptance Co. Sec.\nLitig. (‘Enterprise’), 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir.\n2oo4). Here, the text and history of Section 3283 estab-\nlish that Congress intended to extend the time to bring\ncharges of child sexual abuse in cases where the limi-\ntations period had not yet expired.\n\nPrior to 2oo3, any child sex abuse offense could be\nprosecuted until the victim reached the age of 25 years,\nat which point the statute of limitations then in effect\nwould bar prosecution. In the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, which\nwas titled, “No Statute of Limitations for Child Abduc-\ntion and Sex Crimes,” Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, § 2o2, ll7\nStat. 66o, Congress explicitly provided that “[n]o stat-\nute of limitations that would otherwise preclude pros-\necution for [such an offense] shall preclude such pros-\necution during the life of the child.” l8 U.S.C. § 32838\n(2oo3). The <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> draws no distinction between\npre-enactment and post-enactment conduct. Instead,\nas Judge Nathan explained, by stating that “no statute\nof limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecu-\ntion of these offenses will apply,” the <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>’s\n“plain language unambiguously requires that it apply\nto prosecutions for offenses commited before the date\nof enactment.” (A.l5l). Thus, the breadth of the text\nshous that Congress intended “to extend the ... stat-\nute of limitations,” even for pre-enactment conduct.\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir.\n2oo5) (reaching same conclusion as to § 3283’s prede-\ncessor based on similar “title and ... wording” of stat-\nute); cf. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o7 (describing provi-\nsion that “no limitation shall terminate the period\nwithin which suit may be filed” as example of statute\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l694\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021695.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page48 of 93\n35\n\nreflecting clear congressional intent to apply to pre-en-\nactment conduct).®\n\nLegislative history confirms this conclusion. In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted”\nbecause he was “identified ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021696.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page49 of 93\n36\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the limita-\ntions period).\n\nMaxwell notes that Congress “considered—and re-\njected—a retroactivity clause” before enacting the\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>. (Br.55). But as Judge Nathan recog-\nnized, “the legislative history makes clear that Con-\ngress abandoned the retroactivity provision ... be-\ncause it would have produced unconstitutional re-\nsults.” (A.l52 (discussing co-sponsor remarks express-\ning concern that “the proposed retroactivity provision\nwas ‘of doubtful constitutionality because it ‘would\nhave revived the government’s authority to prosecute\ncrimes that were previously time-barred’”)).9 Thus,\nthe rejection of the retroactivity clause “shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to\nits constitutional applications, including past conduct\n—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations\nhad not yet expired.” (/d.).\n\n9 Maxwell contests this explanation of the retro-\nactivity clause’s rejection because Stogner v. Califor-\nnia, 5389 U.S. 6o7 (2oo3), had not yet been decided.\n(Br.56-57). But the co-sponsor could hardly have been\nclearer in expressing his constitutional doubts. And\nthe co-sponsor did not need Stogner as a basis for his\nconcern, as courts and Congress have long recognized\nthe distinction between permissible extensions of un-\nexpired statutes of limitations and impermissible ex-\ntensions of expired statutes of limitations.

Because Congress has expressly extended the\nstatute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge\nNathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf\nstep one. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already completed.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make application of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate secondary rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), this Court considered a new\nstatute of limitations that shortened the time to file\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021698.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page5l of 93\n38\n\ncertain discrimination claims, and held that applying\nthe new statute in a case “filed after its enactment, but\narising out of events that predate its enactment,” is not\nimpermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”). Thus, like the new statute in Vernon, the\n2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> “impaired no rights possessed by ei-\nther party, increased neither party’s liability, nor im-\nposed any new duties with respect to past transac-\ntions.” Id. at 89o.\n\nEnterprise does not alter this conclusion. There,\nthis Court considered whether an amended statute of\nlimitations operated to “revive already expired securi-\nties fraud claims.” Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o5. While\nacknouledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-\ncation of a revised statute of limitations generally does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the\nCourt concluded that “the resurrection of previously\ntime-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive\neffect.” Id. at 4o9-lo (emphasis removed).

Thus, unlike En-\nterprise, where resurrection of expired claims would\nhave “stripp[ed] [defendants] of a complete affirmative\ndefense they previously possessed,” id. at 4lo, here\nMaxwell never possessed that complete defense. Judge\nNathan correctly concluded that the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\naccordingly “did not deprive [Maxwell] of any vested\nrights.” (A.l53).\n\nTo be sure, this Court has observed that there may\nbe “colorable arguments” that “the logic of Enterprise\nextends to criminal cases where the defendant’s stat-\nute of limitations defense had not vested when the lim-\nitations period was extended” because the extension\n“increases the period of time during which a defend-\nant can be sued,’ thereby ‘increasing a defendant’s lia-\nbility for past conduct.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57\n(quoting Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4lo); see also United\nStates v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 644-46 (lst Cir. 2ol8)\n(discussing potential defense arguments). But such a\nclaim runs headlong into “the vast weight of retroac-\ntivity decisions,” which recognize that “revoking a\nvested statute of limitations defense is different from\nretroactively extending the filing period for a still-via-\nble claim.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57 (collecting\ncases).\n\nFor example, “in the criminal context, there is a\nconsensus that extending a limitations period before\nprosecution is time-barred does not run afoul of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution.” Cruz v. Maypa,\n773 F.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); see also Stogner, 539\nU.S. at 632 (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021700.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page53 of 93\nAO\n\n“does not prevent the State from extending time limits\nfor... prosecutions not yet time barred”). As this Court\nexplained long ago, while it is “unfair and dishonest”\nfor the government to “assure a man that he has be-\ncome safe from its pursuit” but then “withdraw its as-\nsurance,” it is permissible to extend a statute of limi-\ntations “while the chase is on.” Falter v. United States,\n23 F.2d 42o, 426 (2d Cir. l928) (L. Hand, J.). These ex\npost facto cases are particularly instructive here be-\ncause “Landgraf and the Ex Post Facto Clause are in-\nformed by the same retroactivity concerns.” Cruz, 778\nF.3d at l45; see also Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 266 (citing\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause as an “expression” of “the an-\ntiretroactivity principle” it was applying).\n\nThus, applying the Section 3283's 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>\nto Maxwell’s unexpired charges is permissible under\nLandgraf. As the Tenth Circuit recently explained\nwith respect to the very same statute of limitations at\nissue here:\n\nBy extending the unexpired statute of\nlimitations, Congress did not increase\n[defendant’s] exposure to prosecution ret-\nroactively. It did not raise the penalty for\nthe charged offense. It did not redefine\nthe offense to make it easier to establish.\nIt did not expose [defendant] to criminal\nprosecution anew.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct.

We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate.

The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span> is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth <span class=\"highlight\">Amendment</span>. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this\ntestimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.

In turn,\n“Tt]he core of criminality of an offense involves the essence of a crime,\nin general terms; the particulars of hou a defendant effected the crime\nfalls outside that purview.”\n\nWe agree with the District Court that the jury instructions, the\nevidence presented at trial, and the Government's summation\ncaptured the core of criminality.

To allege a variance, a defendant “must\nestablish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the\nevidence alleged in the indictment.” To prevail and win reversal, the\ndefendant must further shou “that substantial prejudice occurred at\ntrial as a result” of the variance.“ “A defendant cannot demonstrate\nthat he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character\nthat could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the\nvariance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” ”\n\nFor reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the\nconstructive <span class=\"highlight\">amendment</span>, the evidence at trial did not prove facts\n4 A-387; see United States v.
