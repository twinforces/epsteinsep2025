The sheer volume of media reporting\nmentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in\nliterally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media\natention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In\nNovember 2ol9, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £lo,ooo bounty for information\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read:\n“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £lo,ooo reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal\nGhislaine Maxwell.”!° And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media\nreports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid\nquestioning by the FBI.'! She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in\nthe bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o, her counsel has been flooded\nwith hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public.\n\nThe “open season” declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein’s death has come with an\neven darker cost — she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and\nhas had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only\nintensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends.

Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that the press was on the\ngrounds and approaching the house. (/d.). In accordance with the procedure that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. (/d.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest: she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the discovery produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered. It would make\nno sense for her to try to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo44", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021029.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o3 of 22l\n28\nMeSsQmaxl\nl your Honor.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">helicopter</span> and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033157.jpg": "Jf iy.

The first trip was on September l4, 2oo9 when he traveled by\n<span class=\"highlight\">helicopter</span> to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach\nCounty by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only\nother passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by\nprobation. On August 27, 2oo9 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to\nSikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova\naccompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of\ntransportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights\ntaken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">helicopter</span> but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami <span class=\"highlight\">helicopter</span> trip as well as another\ndocument confirming the September l4, 2oo9 Palm Beach - Miami <span class=\"highlight\">helicopter</span> flight. | am\nalso enclosing documents for the August 27, 2oo9 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.\nOn another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State\nAtorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of\nnis probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with\nprobation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. | note that many\nof the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scot Rothstein law\nOne Clearlake Centre, Suite l4oo 25o Australian Avenue South West Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\np 56l.659.83oo 56l.835.869l www.agwpa.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l57", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033168.jpg": "Master Case: 2oo8CFoo938lAMB Investigative Cage Wo.\n<< REQUEST FOR ASSIGNMENT Of INVESTIGATOR >>\nTo: INVESTIGATIONS Dates November 3o, 2oo9\nFrom: BARBARA J.
