Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid sufficient foundation for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan Alessi, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, Alessi personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and recognized it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, Alessi testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he recognized from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically recognized entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G. (/d.)\n\nAlthough Alessi only worked in the Palm Beach house until the end of 2oo2, he explained\nthat the practice during his twelve years that he worked for Epstein was to print new directories\ntwice a year. Tr. at 864. He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853.

Tr. at 832; see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (permiting authentication based on the\n“contents” of the item). Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52. (See id. at 872-73, 875 “The botom line\nhere, Mr. Alessi, you don’t have any personal knouledge about first hou or when Exhibit 52 was\ncreated; correct?”).! But authentication does not require evidence about the circumstances of the\ncreation or seizure of a piece of evidence, so long as it can be identified by its distinctive markings\nas what the proponent claims it is. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25. It is well setled that\ndefects in chain of custody go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSecond, the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual—dating from 2oo5, the year on Government Exhibit 52—\ndemonstrates that the practice identified by Alessi remained in operation into 2oo5. The manual\nexplains that “[t]elephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone\ndirectories are available.” GX 6o6 at 7. And it explained that the directories in fact belong to the\ndefendant and Epstein: a copy of their directories “must be placed to the right of each telephone\n(except for the Guestrooms).” GX 6o6 at 7.\n\nThird, the contents of Government Exhibit 52 have been confirmed by other evidence to\naccurately reflect relationships between the defendant and other individuals.

As for the appearance, he testified that GX 52\nhad “exactly the same cover of the directories that I saw,” “the same binding,” and “exactly” the\n“layout” as the books he recalled. /d. at 85l. While he did note that GX 52 was thinner and had\n“much smaller font” than the books he recalled, he overall testified that the “format was the\nsame.” /d. at 852.

Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you\n\nabout the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n\nTr. 2848:l6-22 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 2853:l4-l6 (“The paterns you saw throughout\nthis trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways that you knou\nthat Maxwell is guilty.”’).\n\nThe common “playbook” that the government described started by targeting vulnerable\nkids, like the four accusers, who all came from single-mother households with financial or other\nhardships. Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their\nparents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8952", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos. In its opening and closing statements, the\ngovernment gave great emphasis to the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual as evidence that Ms.\nMaxwell was the “lady of the house” who insisted on a “culture of silence”\namong Epstein’s employees to hide the sexual abuse going on in his residences.\nTr. 34, 2846-47. The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse throughout the relevant time period. The defense believes she\ncould have testified that Ms. Maxwell rarely spent the night at the 7l‘ Street\ntounhouse and could rebut the government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell was\nalways by Epstein’s side.\n\nFor these reasons and the reasons set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous submissions, the\nCourt should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due\nto prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n\nIV. The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a Reasonable\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts. Tr. 2266:4-2274:l4. The Court denied the defendant’s motion. Tr. 2274:l6.\nFollouing the close of the defense case, Ms. Maxwell reasserted her Rule 29 motion for the\nreasons initially stated. Tr. 2736:8-9. Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts that same motion and\nincorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court, in the\nalternative, (l) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on the Mann Act counts (Counts One through\nFour) and grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a constructive\namendment and/or variance from the allegations in the Indictment, (2) enter judgment on only\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8959", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009251.jpg": "Case PAECIOOS8O-PAEUBOOUEA AN OA7 Fil@dWz/24/22gePagee 29 of 67\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nFebruary l5,2ol2) | PAUL M.

They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously. The leter of David's\nbrother-in-law, James Yeter, describes it best:\n[David's] three sons (my nephews) are wonderful young men with\nexceptional character traits that I knou are a direct result of Dave’s\nstrong parenting ....

In\naddition, the defendant listed as a defense witness one employee who worked for Epstein in his\nNew York residence at East 7l“ Street in the mid-l99os, but tellingly elected to not call that\nwitness. (Def. Dec. l4, 2o2l Leter to Court). The defendant also cites the absence of Sally\nMarkham, claiming that she “could have testified that the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual [Government Exhibit\n6o6] was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual knoun as ‘the Countess,’ whom\nEpstein brought in to ‘professionalize’ his staff.” (Def.

The defendant’s bald\nassertions about Markham’s testimony are speculative and belied by the trial record. Finally, the\ndefendant’s musings about what Fontanilla “could have testified” about (Def. Mot. at 3o)—the\ndetails of which are sparse—do not “demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to [her] ability to\ndefend [herself].” Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657.

They have supported each other’s careers --\nwhen Theresa found a beter position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody\nto move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and community. They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously. The leter of David's\nbrother-in-law, James Yeter, describes it best:\n[David's] three sons (my nephews) are wonderful young men with\nexceptional character traits that I knou are a direct result of Dave’s\nstrong parenting ....

They are expected to\nhave jobs in the summer. They have a healthy regard and respect\nfor others. Study time is sacred. Responsibilities are not to be\ntaken lightly. It’s not “enforced,” it’s an expectation.\nLeter of James W. Yeter.\nOther leters confirm Mr. Yeter’s observations. See leter of Andrew Miller\n(“[h]is emphasis and influence on his children have also resulted in good, respectful, well-\nrounded and academic kids”); leter of Phil Allen (David “teaches by example, and extolls the\nvalues of hard work and mutual respect; everyone pitches in, whether it is preparing a family\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 4o of 45\n2ooos that could have testified the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual was created by “the Countess,” not the\nDefendant; and Lynn Fontanilla, a live-in housekeeper for Epstein in New York that could have\ntestified about the Defendant’s and Epstein’s habits.\n\nNone of these identified pieces of alleged evidence satisfies the Defendant’s burden of\nproving actual and substantial prejudice. The Court addresses first the documentary evidence.\nFirst, the Defendant does not atest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to\nshou. Though the Defendant would herself be best positioned to explain her oun financial\ntransactions (or the lack thereof), her brief does not suggest what the absent financial records\nwould have shoun. Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shoun in\nthe absent phone records. The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were\nmissing. At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September\nll, 2ool, were far less detailed than modern manifests. E.g., Trial Tr. at 25l8-22. The\nDefendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed. The location\nand appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial. The\nDefendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official\nproperty records.\n\nSecond, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the\nDefendant fails to shou why the evidence, if admited at trial, would have benefited her case.\nThe Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her:\nan absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the\nDefendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests. But this\npresumption is purely speculative. Each piece of evidence may very well have further\nsubstantiated the Government’s case. Because the Defendant carries the burden of proof, she is\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially prejudiced by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial prejudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points’’).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)). The Defendant provides no basis to conclude that the jury\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page8of55\nside with Epstein, Maxwell also received a tounhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York\nCity, and Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to Maxwell during the timeframe\nof the conspiracy. (/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\n<span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s respective bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the massage oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). Alessi explained during his trial testimony that he understood he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 24 of55\naffirmative steps to withdraw.” Meneilly, 28 F. App’x at 32 (citations omited). The defendant\nhas not claimed, as a legal mater, that there is any evidence that she withdrew from the conspiracy,\nnor could she. Instead, she argues, as a policy mater, that the 2oo4 Manual should not be applied\nbecause the defendant had “moved on,” an expression that has no legal meaning.\n\nMore importantly, documentary evidence establishes that the defendant remained a close\nassociate of Jeffrey Epstein for multiple years after 2oo2. In particular:\n\ne Flight records reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet 49 times in 2oo3, l9\ntimes in 2oo4, and l6 times in 2oo5. Regarding 2oo4 in particular, the flight records for\nthat year reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet twice in November 2oo4\nand once in December 2oo4, which makes clear that the defendant was still traveling with\nEpstein after the Guidelines were amended and while the conspiracy was ongoing. (GX\n662).\n\ne In October 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department executed a search warrant at the Palm\nBeach residence, and discovered the defendant’s desk, upon which a notepad with her\nnamed stationary was siting. (GX 285). The setup of the defendant’s desk—and\ninstructions that make clear the defendant was a forceful presence in the house—are set\nforth in the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual, which is dated February l4, 2oo5. (GX 6o6).\n\ne Travel agency records from Shopper’s Travel—offered by the defendant at trial—reflect\nthat Epstein paid for the defendant’s flights through at least 2oo6. (DX RS-l (listing a May\nl, 2oo6 flight on Epstein’s account)).\n\ne Bank records reflect that, as of 2oo7, Epstein transferred $7,759,793.4o to the defendant’s\npersonal bank account.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo559", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies\n\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nId. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\nGuidelines provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo565", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 37 of55\ncrimes. For the reasons set forth belou, the nature and seriousness of the offense weigh in favor\nof a Guidelines sentence, in light of the role the defendant played in the conspiracy and the\nirreparable harm the defendant caused to her victims.\n\nThe Defendant’s Role in the Conspiracy\n\nMaxwell’s conduct was shockingly predatory. She was a calculating, sophisticated, and\ndangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough there are many unsetling aspects of the defendant’s conduct, what stands out\nfrom the trial record is that she worked with Epstein to select victims who she knew were\nvulnerable to exploitation. As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an essential role in the conspiracy by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a relationship of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the treatment of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm. We knou that the more\nthey trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel\nbetrayed, the more betrayal there’s been. And to the extent there’s\nbeen betrayal in the relationship, then the individuals are really\nstruggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo572", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”).

(internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v.

To summarize, the Government’s\nargument for authentication has to date relied on the testimony of a former employee (“Employee-\nl”) of Epstein’s who worked for him in | | along with a <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual that corroborates\nthat multiple copies of the contact book existed. (See Dkt. No. 457, 49l). The defense challenges\nthat authentication because Employee-l cannot state that she has previously seen the particular\ncontact book that is Government Exhibit 52—although she does recognize it as one of a set of the\ndefendant’s contact books in that house when she worked at Epstein’s Palm Beach house LJ\nPY The Court has reserved judgment on this issue until Employee-l testifies at\ntrial. (ll/23/2l Tr. at l6).!\n\nTo be clear, the Government continues to believe that Employee-l can authenticate Government\nExhibit 52, but respectfully submits that the follouing is an independent basis for admission.\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of6\nclerked for a judge in 2ol8, assisted with sentencing proceedings during that clerkship, and\nreturned to chambers for a visit in 2o2l could readily identify the book on the table as the 2o2l\nversion of the same Guidelines manual with which she had become so familiar in 2ol8.

As explained on its cover page, Government Exhibit 6o6 is the “<span class=\"highlight\">Household</span> Manual”\nfor “358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, FL 3348o”—Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. It is fifty-\neight pages and is dated February l4, 2oo5. The manual contains instructions to give staff “the\nproper guidance and assistance to perform your duties to the best of your ability, while ensuring a\nconsistently high level of service.” GX 6o6 at 3. Among other things, employees are instructed\nto “[t]ry and anticipate the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests,” id. at 4, answer the\ntelephone a certain way, id. at 7, and contains checklists for various tasks, id.at lo-46.\n\nAlessi is a witness with knouledge that the manual “is what it is claimed to be.” Fed.

He recognizes Government Exhibit 6o6 as a version of the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual\nthat the defendant gave Alessi and his wife, in the form of a booklet, in approximately the late\nl99os or early 2ooos. See 35o4-o46. Alessi reviewed the manual and specifically recalls each\npage except for certain portions on pages 7, 9, l3, l6, l9, 3o, 3l, and 33, such as particular phrases\nor items on a shopping list. For instance, he recalls the checklists as tasks which he had to\ncomplete, and recalls that the defendant was angry that Alessi did not fill out the checklists.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of6\nAlessi is therefore a witness able to authenticate the Government Exhibit 6o6. Although\n\nthe manual itself is dated to 2oo5 on its face, Alessi is expected to testify that the exhibit is largely\nunchanged from the version he had when he received from the defendant and Epstein.

Since you're going back so far in the '94s, I believe that\n22 was before cellphones even.

Again and again, the\n2l evidence at this trial shoued you hou closely Maxwell was\n22 involved in Epstein's so-called massages.

Respect their privacy.\n\n5 You learned that this pouerful warning to employees\n\n6 was effective. Here's Mr. Alessi's testimony about that. He\n\n7 explained that this rule was a kind of warning that he was\n\n8 supposed to be blind, deaf, and dumb, to say nothing of their\n\n9 lives.\n\nlo Ladies and gentlemen, nou that you've sat through this\nll entire trial, you knou exactly why Maxwell told workers in the\nl2 house to see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. It's\n\nl3 because she was Epstein's partner in crime. And in that house,\nl4 behind closed doors, Maxwell and Epstein were commiting\n\nl5 horrifying crimes.\n\nl6 That brings us to the second reason. The second\n\nl7 reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the\nl8 same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited\n\nl9 young girls. The similarities between what happened to Jane\n2o and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful evidence\n2l of the defendant's guilt. So I want to talk to you about the\n22 playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n23 Before we talk about this, remember that you heard\n24 from Dr. Rocchio, an expert psychologist who specializes in\n25 treating victims of sexual abuse for the trauma they suffered\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 257 2849\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl as a result of their childhood experiences. She told you that\n2 childhood sexual abuse typically occurs in an established\n\n3 relationship by a perpetrator who's knoun to the victim.

It is not an\n2o accident that Jane and Kate and Annie and Carolyn all came from\nal single-mother households. It is not an accident that all of\n22 their families were struggling in different ways.

And what the manual shous you is that Maxwell and\n\n5 Epstein had a phone directory, and they kept several copies of\n6 it in the house. There was a copy in the pool area, there was\n7 a copy in their cars, there was a copy of it in the master\n\n8 bedroom, and most importantly, there was a copy right on\n\n9 Maxwell's desk.\n\nlo Here's the part of the manual that tells you that.\n\nll There was a copy on her desk. And they're not just any\n\nl2 directories. In the manual, they're the JE and GM telephone\n\nl3 directories. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. When Juan\nl4 Alessi testified, he was asked about a litle black book and he\nl5 testified that he recognized it as one of those books.\n\nl6 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 52-G, which\nl7 is a page from that book. Here it is. So the section on this\nl8 page is titled \"Massage Florida.\" I'm going to highlight a few\nl9 specific entries in a moment, but first let's just start with\n2o the basics.

For years, Maxwell took trips on\n22 Epstein's private planes with Epstein and teenage girls. For\n23 years, Maxwell was right by Epstein's side as numerous teenage\n24 girls came to visit him inside his homes. There were teenage\n25 boys, by the way.

The Court addresses first the documentary evidence.\nFirst, the Defendant does not atest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to\nshou. Though the Defendant would herself be best positioned to explain her oun financial\ntransactions (or the lack thereof), her brief does not suggest what the absent financial records\nwould have shoun. Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shoun in\nthe absent phone records. The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were\nmissing. At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September\nll, 2ool, were far less detailed than modern manifests. F.g., Trial Tr. at 25l8-22. The\nDefendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed. The location\nand appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial. The\nDefendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official\nproperty records.\n\nSecond, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the\nDefendant fails to shou why the evidence, if admited at trial, would have benefited her case.\nThe Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her:\nan absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the\nDefendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests. But this\npresumption is purely speculative. Each piece of evidence may very well have further\nsubstantiated the Government’s case. Because the Defendant carries the burden of proof, she is\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021026.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2oo of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially prejudiced by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial preyudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points”).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)).

Patasnik,\n2 89 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. l996). The Guidelines define a participant\n3 as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of\n4 the offense, but need not have been convicted.

I credit that\nl7 testimony which is corroborated by further testimony that the\nl8 defendant was Epstein's number two and the lady of the house.\nl9 At some point, Kellen took over some of the defendants duties.\n2o But even after that time, the defendant retained her leadership\n2l position, as evidenced by Carolyn's testimony, by flight\n22 records in evidence, and the <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual in evidence.

For over a decade, Maxwell\ntraveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his pri-\nvate planes and mingled with rich and famous people,\nwhile enjoying a life of extraordinary luxury. (Tr.96-\n99, 233-34, 3o3-o4, ll94). Maxwell and Epstein spent\ntime together in Epstein’s various properties, includ-\ning his mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhatan,\nhis villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his\napartment in Paris, and his private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands. (Tr.99). Maxwell also received a toun-\nhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York City,\nand Epstein transferred more than $23 million to Max-\nwell during the timeframe of the conspiracy. (Tr.ll94,\nl3lo-l7).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, Max-\nwell also supervised Epstein’s households as “the lady\nof the house.” (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of\nEpstein’s homes, she imposed strict rules for staff,\nsome of which were included in a <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual\ndictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence.\n(Tr.8o7-o8, 823-3l).\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure,\nMaxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s\nhomes. (Tr.784, 826). The <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual made\nclear that staff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say\nnothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (Tr.826). Maxwell directed Juan Alessi,\nthe former manager of Epstein’s Palm Beach villa, to\nspeak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look\nEpstein in the eyes.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84).

(Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence. (Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild predators. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic\nstress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-\ndren are most frequently sexually abused through\ngrooming and coercion in the context of a relationship.\n(Tr.7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a se-\nries of deceptive tactics to engage a child in sexual\nabuse.

Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-\nstein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s assistant.\n(A.4l7; see Tr.l39-4o, l89o). Judge Nathan found that\ntestimony credible, in part because it was corroborated\nby other testimony that Maxwell was Epstein’s “num-\nber two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach\nwhere much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen\nworked. (A.4l7). The trial evidence shoued that Kellen\nscheduled sexualized massages and took nude photo-\ngraphs of Carolyn. (PSR 4 66; Tr.l554-55). Even after\nKellen took over some of Maxwell’s duties, Maxwell\ncontinued to manage her by virtue of her position in\nthe house, a fact corroborated by a <span class=\"highlight\">household</span> manual\ndirecting staff to tend to the specific needs of Epstein,\nMaxwell, and their guests, as well as flight records\nshouing that Maxwell and Kellen flew together on Ep-\nstein’s planes dozens of times.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of inferstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe details that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around ‘\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s fegal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran lawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. ;\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched background\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\neee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030420.jpg": "NTE >;\n: VUA DLALEMEN'L HISTORY ites 4\n‘ae Jan. l8. 2oo58ll: 2oAVOR accousr, qog-son-orne\n, CHISLAINE MAXWELL OR ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ DATE LAST STATEMENT l2/22/o4\n« <span class=\"highlight\">HOUSEHOLD</span> ACCOUNT DATE THIS STATEMENT ol/l8/o5\n****k*DDA TRANSACTIONS* ****\nBEGINNING CHECKS/OTHER DEBITS DEPOSITS/OTHER CREDITS ENDING\nBALANCE NBR TOTAL AMOUNT NBR TOTAL AMOUNT BALANCE\n5825.46 22 l8829,2o 2 2oooo.oo 6996.26\nDATE CK NBR AMOUNT TP TRANSACTION DESCRIPTION A\" + Wosnahor\nl2/l4 2526 5ooo.oo CK TELLER CASHED CHECK “ l© > t “,l387.32\nl2/l4 2525 looo.oo CK TELLER CASHED CHECK voll, Cock B 387.32\nl2/l5 loooo.oo CR INCOMING WIRE CREDIT lo387.32\nl2/l5 2523 6oo.oo DB FORCE PAY DEBIT 9787.32\nl2/l5 3o.oo DB NSF CHARGE 9757.32\nl2/l5 lo.oo DB INCOMING WIRE FEE 9747.32\nl2/l6 2527 5o3.5o CK CHECK 9243.82\nl2/l7 2529 ll3.42 DB TIRES PLUS FT LA EFT 9l3o.4o\nl2/2o 2528 l3oo.oo CK CHECK 783o.4o\nl2/2o. 2533 42o.oo CK CHECK 74lo.4o\nl2/2l 253l 26o.44 CK CHECK 7l49.96\nl2/2l 253o l53.7o CK CHECK 6996.26\nPFl - PAGE FWD PF2 - PAGE BKWD\n| oa\no7/26/l7 Page 67 of ll4 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o42o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030421.jpg": "Ne le \"\nx VUA 2LALEMENL HISTORY No. 3258.7.P. 3 PAGE 3\n‘JEJan. l8. 2oo5ll: 2oAMoR ACCOUNT ooo-ooo-Quui =**%-~~\"e8\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL OR ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ DATE LAST STATEMENT l2/22/o4\n_ <span class=\"highlight\">HOUSEHOLD</span> ACCOUNT DATE THIS STATEMENT ol/l8/o5\nsa *#***kDDA TRANSACTIONS *****\nBEGINNING CHECKS/OTHER DEBITS DEPOSITS/OTHER CREDITS ENDING\nBALANCE NBR TOTAL AMOUNT NBR TOTAL AMOUNT BALANCE\n5925.46 23 l956l.72 3 2oooo.53 6264.27\nDATE CK NBR AMOUNT TP TRANSACTION DESCRIPTION BALANCE\nl2/22 252o 732.52 CK CHECK 6263.74\nl2/22 o.53 CR IOD INTEREST PAID 6264.27\nLAST’ PAGE PF2 - PAGE BKWD\n|\no7/26/l7 Page 68 of ll4 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n- DOJ-OGR-ooo3o42l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030422.jpg": "De ee ee es ee ee ee\nte DUA SLATEMENT I R wp. 4 l\n* geJdan. l8. 2oo5ll: 2oAMpR = nen obo-ane-oltee \"PAS\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL OR ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ DATE THIS STATEMENT ol/l8/o5\n«+ <span class=\"highlight\">HOUSEHOLD</span> ACCOUNT DATE LAST STATEMENT l2/22/o4\n*#*#**DDA TRANSACTIONS* ****\nBALANCE CHECKS/OTHER DEBITS DEPOSITS/OTHER CREDITS BALANCE\n\nLAST STATEMENT NBR TOTAL AMOUNT NBR TOTAL AMOUNT THIS STATEMENT\n\n6264.27 ll 765o.65 63 loooo.oo 86l3.62\nDATE CK NBR AMOUNT TY TRANSACTION DESCRIPTION BALANCE\nl2/23 2534 l6o.oo CHECK 6lo4.27\nl2/24. 2532 495.7l CHECK 56o8.56\nl2/3o loooo.oo INCOMING WIRE CREDIT\nl2/3o | Mee lo.oo INCOMING WIRE FEE ww l5598.56\nl2/3l \\\\2/3qot) 2535 2ooo.oo TELLER CASHED CHECK > ™ Ve tl, Ces, l359o.56\nol/o3 ™ 2538 2loo.oo TELLER CASHED CHECK © creme ll498.56\nol/o4 254l l66.99 CHECK\nol/o4 2537 l32.29 CHECK ll99.28\nol/o6. 254o 65.oo CHECK uth ll34.28\nol/o7 [iJodon) 2542 a 2ooo.oo TELLER CASHED CHECK © BAVoll,Cosh 9l34.28\nol/lo-\\ 2539 l8o.5o CHECK 8953.78\nOl/il- 2543 34o.l6 CHECK 86l3.62\nPFl - PAGE FWD\n\nMe ee\nig Abe)\no7/26/l7 Page 69 of ll4 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030423.jpg": "j “.

I then accompanied CSEU\ntech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once\nthis was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house\nwith Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.\n\nWe began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a\nHarley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage.\n\nNothing of evidentiary value was located.\n\nWe then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east\nside.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe detais that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around .\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s legal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran fawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. .\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched background\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\nSee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44"};
