Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo968", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001094.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel53 of 2oo 9o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl evidentiary hearing within one week. In contrast, the\n\n2 defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted\n\n3 defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access\n\n4 counsel. Indeed the defense's logic, all pretrial detainees\n\n5 currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would\n\n6 need to be released to prepare their defense. To the contrary,\n7 the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> access at the facility, and the defendants\n\n9 detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences\nlo with their atorneys. There is ongoing litigation before\n\nll Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the\n\nl2 adequacy of <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> access at the MDC. That is case\n\nl3 No. l9 Civ. 66o. Public filings from the court-appointed\n\nl4 mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone\nl5 calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of\n\nl6 reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their\n\nl7 counsel, and that same report indicates that MDC is currently\nl8 developing a plan to resume in-person <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> visits in\nl9 the near future.\n2o At this stage in this case and at this point in the\n2l pandemic in New York City, these measures are sufficient to\n22 ensure Ms. Maxwell has access to her counsel. To further\n23 assuage these concerns, the court orders the government in this\n24 case, and frankly all others before it, to work with the\n25 defense to provide adequate communication between counsel and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo94", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001264.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ooBBQHANAt DOctMe rt l/2o 2 Filedeas/2o/PagPage aol66l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic discovery, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop. Her receipt of legal mail — including pretrial motions, responses and replies\n—are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC. The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001411.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 7o-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Paged of l4\n\ngoing through her <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> materials; and (6) can’t search, print,\nhighlight, or sort the discovery because the “computer” she was given was\nstripped doun and does not have the proper software or hardware\ncapabilities. The truth is that Ms. Maxwell is not being treated in a\nhumane fashion and cannot prepare for trial under these horrific\nconditions. She has been in solitary confinement with no sleep for almost\na year. The presumption of innocence has been turned on its head. This\nCourt should either order her temporary release under l8 U.S.C. 3l42)\nor remand this mater and order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary\nhearing on the conditions of her confinement.\n\nIt is important to underscore that the government has made a\nnumber of representations to the trial court and to this Court about the\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention that have proven to be false.\n\nl.

The court declined to have a hearing or\norder the videotape turned over. The truth is actually out there.

The defense has, over and over again, requested\nhearings and that the videotapes of what is occurring in jail be produced.\nBut the district court said that the defense “describes generalized\ngrievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for\nrelief.” Doc. 282.

As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings.

The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n° Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial.

See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported l2/7/2o). While Ms. Maxwell is\nisolated from general population inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are\nnot subject to mandatory testing, with some guards assigned to her detail rotating in from BOP\nfacilities where inmates and staff have tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may not be\nexposed to other inmates, she is exposed to individuals while escorted to a common area for\nbody scanning, further risking her exposure to COVID.\n\nWhile reciting BOP policy, the leter fails to address:\n\n= why as an isolated inmate, Ms. Maxwell is subject to repeated searching;\n\n=» why Ms. Maxwell is under 24/7 surveillance by a cadre of officers who are\nrequired to report her status every l5 minutes;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell is constantly surveilled by a hand-held camera, even during\n<span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> conferences;\n\n= why all of Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails were erased from the CorrLinks system;\n\n=\" why immediately after receiving two nasal swab COVID tests, Ms. Maxwell was\nrequired to remove her mask for an in-mouth inspection, heightening her exposure\nto COVID as she was placed in quarantine;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.\n\nWarden Tellez has failed to respond to our assertion that the MDC has imposed\nextraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic\nconsequences of negligence occurring at the MCC that resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Atorney General of the United States has said as much. Beyond the decision to not place\nMs. Maxwell in general population, to which we have no objection, the leter virtually concedes\nthat other restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are not in response to any concern specific to her\nand tacitly suggests the heightened restrictions are in response to the high-profile nature of the\ncase and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself —\nalive. As ABC News reported:\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year.

And so I'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.” A source said the\n\nBOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust and confidence as\n\nwell as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.”\n\nWhat is clear is that the Government is “livid” over the death of Epstein and is seeking to\nrepair its reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions; not in any\nresponse to Ms. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a\ncompletely different defendant.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee who has never received a disciplinary\ndemerit. The purpose of this leter is not simply to express complaint due to the institutional\nviolations and denial of rights suffered by Ms. Maxwell in relation to her pretrial incarceration.\nRather, it seeks to bring an unwarranted situation to your atention - conditions that are unduly\ncruel and punitive and circumstances that are deleteriously impacting our client’s ability to\nprepare her defense which, in turn, interferes with our ability to provide the legal representation\nto which she, and any other detainee, deserves.\n\nWe continue our ongoing atempt to resolve these maters without court intervention. We\nhave voiced complaint through the MDC Legal Department, your office, the AUSAs in charge\nof this case, and the Federal Defenders of New York.* Ms. Maxwell has atempted to resolve\nthese maters by follouing the internal prison procedures, filing writen complaints to her unit\ncounselor (BP8), to the warden (BP9), and to the regional office (BP lo), to seek remediation as\nset forth in the BOP manuals and inmate handbook. All to no avail.\n\nDraconian Conditions of Pretrial Detention\n\nMs. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are extraordinarily onerous - and unlike those\nof any other inmate at the MDC (or in BOP custody, to our knouledge). In fact, in the time that\nMs. Maxwell has been at the MDC, she has met with five separate wardens and interim wardens,\nmany who have remarked that they have never seen in their collective years of experience\n* See, “Ghislaine Maxwell given paper clothes at correctional center to avoid suicide atempt: Sources\nJeffrey Epstein, her associate, died by suicide in jail last August.”’ btps://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-\nmaxwell-paper-clothes-correctional-center-avoid-suicide/story?id=7l699ooo (emphasis added).\n> The Federal Defenders of New York has been tasked with scheduling of <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communication\nin connection with ongoing litigation against the MDC based on conditions of confinement during\nCOVID pending in the Eastern District of New York before the Honorable Margo K.

STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 9o of 9l 9o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl evidentiary hearing within one week.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms.\nMaxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by\nproviding Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-person <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms.\nMaxwell’s lawyers categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against\nMDC staff based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates\nno views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either\nside’s allegations. This Court’s obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the\ndefendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-\nclient communications, and prepare for trial.\nMindful of that obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After\nreceiving the defense’s first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause\nwhy the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in\npart defense counsel’s original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain\nquestions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to ensure the\nconfidentiality of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyer-client communications.

Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of\ndefense counsel’s preservation leter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel\nare entitled to view or receive copies of those materials as a mater of law, they should be\nprovided. To the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this\nCourt, that application is denied.\n\nThe Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the opportunity\nto meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all relevant circumstances\nand consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates in BOP custody. The isolated\nincident that took place on April 24, 2o2l, and the serious allegations leveled by MDC legal\ncounsel and defense counsel in no way undermine the Court’s conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and\nher lawyers are fully able to prepare for trial.

Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 4\nI. The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v.

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability.

Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 _ Filed o6/o4/2l Page3of6\nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she\ntook with Epstein.

Her Rule 6l2 argument is\nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to\nproduction of the entire journal.

There were no problems with VTCs with\nthe exception of when the MDC placed the VTC monitor inside a box with a screen, which severely\nimpacted Ms. Maxwell’s ability to see counsel and documents shoun to her. That issue, which arose on\nJune l4, 2o2l, was resolved between defense counsel and the MDC.\n\nHouever, on August 6, 2o2l, MDC Legal sent counsel an email stating that starting Monday\n(August 9\") we could no longer use defense counsel’s WebEx platform for the VTCs, and instead had to\nuse any of four Zoom access codes provided by the MDC. When questioned why the platform was\nbeing changed from WebEx to Zoom, MDC Legal stated the VTC platform was changed due to\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell. Upon information and belief, the complaints concerned visual\nevidence that someone on MDC’s end of the WebEx connection, other than Ms. Maxwell, appeared on\nthe screen as a VTC participant called “NER/BRO,” adjusted the volume during the VTC, and moved\nthe viewing box used to view documents on the screen. During the past several weeks, interruption in\nMs. Maxwell’s VTC signal and bandwidth suggested that her connection was split, causing her VTC\nsessions to go in and out, and her screen often turned green and became blurry. No other participants\nexperienced such disruption.\n\nWhen Ms. Maxwell raised these concerns to various staff members, no one seemed surprised.\nThe fact that MDC immediately provided a “more secure” link (in their words) suggests there was some\ntype of breach or interference with the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> VTC which impinged upon confidentiality of\nprivileged <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communication and is placing an on-going chill on communication between\nMs. Maxwell and her defense team.\n\nIt is my understanding that the new MDC Zoom platform does not preclude third parties who\nhave the access information to the Zoom “Courtrooms” from interfering (inadvertently or intentionally)\nwith Ms. Maxwell’s privileged communication.

I also informed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied, that during my in-person\nvisit with Ms. Maxwell on Saturday, August l4\", both Ms. Maxwell and I were told we could\nnot pass documents. This restriction frustrated and affected the productivity of a four-hour visit.\n\nIn a reply email later that day, MDC Legal stated:\n\nPlease understand this is not a simple process and may take a few days.\n\nWith that said you have had access to your client via telephone.\n\nAdditionally, as you have had weekend visit on weekend with Ms. Maxwell,\n\nwe can gladly arrange for the same on any day moving forward.\n\nAs far as your weekend legal visit- the staff who did not allou the\n\npassing of legal documents have been informed of the appropriate\n\ninstructions.\n\nThe restrictions placed on Ms. Maxwell, including limiting the quantity of legal\ndocuments she may bring to the VTC room or day room and the prohibition on review of\ndocuments during in-person legal conferences- coupled with problems with conducting\nconfidential legal conference VTCs - has limited Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial.

In the motion, she renewed her claims\nthat the “horrific conditions [at MDC] make it impossible to prepare for trial.” (/d. at 2; see also\nid. at 2-3 (listing alleged horrific conditions, such as sleep deprivation, broun water, surveillance\nof <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> meetings, overflouing sewage, computer without sufficient capacity to review\ndiscovery)). The Second Circuit denied her motion in a writen order. (See United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 96 (2d Cir. June 2, 2o2l)).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nIn seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden of shouing, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no condition or\ncombination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f);\nUnited States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nHouever, where, as here, the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses\ninvolving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises\n“that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited\nburden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward\nwith evidence that [s]he does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\n433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document52l Filed l2/o3/2l Page2of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 3, 2o2l\nPage 2\nrelevant to her memory and capacity as a witness since she cannot recall a highly consequential\nconversation she had just months ago.”\n\nFor two reasons, the government is wrong to say that the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege bars\nMs. Maxwell from pursuing this line of cross-examination. First, the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege\ndoes not apply to Mr. Glassman’s statement to Jane that cooperating and testifying would “help\nher case.” Second, even if the privilege did apply, it was waived when Mr. Glassman relayed his\nstatement to the government. Ex. l (35o9-o22).\n\n“The <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege protects from disclosure (l) a communication between\nclient and counsel that (2) was intended to be and was in fact kept confidential, and (3) was made\nfor the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.” Jn re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 4l3, 4l9\n(2d Cir. 2oo7). “The burden of establishing the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege, in all its elements,\nalways rests upon the person asserting it.” United States v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237, 244 (2d\nCir. l989). In this case, the party asserting the privilege is the government on behalf of Jane.\n\nThe government has not met its burden. Mr. Glassman’s statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not protected by the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege\nbecause “it was [not] intended to be .. . kept confidential.” Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9. We knou this\nbecause the government would want to knou (if only for purposes of preparing for cross-\nexamination), and Jane would want the government to knou, why she chose to cooperate and to\ntestify against Ms. Maxwell. l McCormick on Evid., § 9l (“Wherever the maters communicated\n\n?

Jan. 2o2o update). Jane’s\nmotivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is essential\nto the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.\n\nPredictably, then, Mr. Glassman shared with the government the advice he gave to Jane,\nso the information was not “in fact kept confidential.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9; see also United\nStates v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487, 494 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3) (addressing assertion of <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span>\nprivilege in respect to documents sought by the defendant in a criminal case and holding that\nprivilege did not apply because there was no evidence “the Company intended the\ncommunications to remain confidential, as it must have in order for the privilege to apply in the\nfirst instance” and because “the Company failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege applies to the documents sought by Defendants”). The atorney-\nclient privilege thus does not apply.\n\nBut even if the privilege did apply, the privilege was waived. “It is well-established that\nvoluntary disclosure of confidential material to a third party generally results in forfeiture of any\napplicable <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege.” United States v. Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here. Mr. Glassman voluntarily communicated\nwith the government that he advised Jane to cooperate with the government because it would\n“help her case,” thereby waiving the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege. And as Fed. R. Evid. 5o2(a)\nrecognizes, “[w]hen the disclosure [of confidential information] is made in a federal proceeding\nor to a federal office,” that generally “waives the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege or work-product\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo82o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document52l Filed l2/o3/2l Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

V, VI. Because the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege does not preclude her from\nasking Mr. Glassman whether he told Jane that cooperating with the government and testifying\nagainst Ms. Maxwell would “help her case,” Ms. Maxwell has a constitutional right to call him\nas a witness and make this inquiry.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Pagelof8\nU.S. Department of Justice\nse, United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Any such testimony is protected by <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span>\nprivilege and, in any event, should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\nl. Applicable Law\nThe “common law” governs claims of privilege in federal cases. Fed. R. Evid. 5ol. And\n“t]he <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications\nknoun to the common law. Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between\natorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observation of law\nand administration of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (l98l); see United\nStates v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237, 243 (2d Cir. l989) (explaining that the privilege “recognizes\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page2of8\nthat a lawyer’s assistance can only be safely and readily availed of when free from the\nconsequences or the apprehension of disclosure” (internal quotation marks omited)). The\nprivilege “protects communications (l) between a client and his or her atorney (2) that are\nintended to be, and in fact were, kept confidential (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing\nlegal advice.” United States v. Krug, 868 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege “belongs solely to the client and may only be waived by [her].\nAn atorney may not waive the privilege without [her] client’s consent.” Jn re von Bulou, 828\nF.2d 94, loo (2d Cir. l987); see Chirac v. Reinicker, 24 U.S. 28o, 294 (l826) (“The privilege,\nindeed, is not that of the atorney, but of the client... .”). Absent such a waiver, houever, “the\npublication of confidential communications by an atorney does not constitute a relinquishment of\nthe privilege by the client.” Jn re von Bulou, 828 F.2d at loo; see Hanson v. U.S. Agency for Int’l\nDev., 372 F.3d 286, 294 (4th Cir. 2oo4) (“Roy as an atorney could not waive USAID’s right\nwithout USAID’s consent.”).' Courts have found that clients have impliedly waived the privilege\n“when a client testifies concerning portions of the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communication, when a client\nplaces the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship directly at issue, and when a client asserts reliance on an\natorney’s advice as an element of a claim or defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d 222, 228\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (alterations and internal quotation marks omited). The “quintessential example of\nan implied waiver of the privilege” occurs when a client asserts an advice-of-counsel defense. /d.\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n‘In “appropriate circumstances,” an atorney “may . . . possess an implied authority to waive the\nprivilege on behalf of his client.” Jn re von Bulou, 828 F.2d at lol (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8238", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page3of8\n\nAlthough criminal defendants possess constitutional rights to “a meaningful opportunity to\npresent a complete defense and to confront witnesses,” those rights are not unqualified. United\nStates v. Rivera, 799 F.3d l8o, l84-85 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomited). “A defendant’s right to present relevant evidence . . . is subject to reasonable\nrestrictions,” and therefore may “bou to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal\ntrial process.” United States v.

Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (l986) (discussing a district court’s\n“wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on concerns about,\namong other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witnesses’ safety, or\ninterrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant,” notwithstanding the Confrontation\nClause). The <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “essential to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page5of8\nto divulge their conversations with counsel about hou significant their atorneys assess the benefits\nof immunity to be.\n\nIn such cases, it is not that these issues are irrelevant to the Government or to the defense.\nThey are highly relevant. But the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communications are privileged, and the\natorney’s advice is not presumptively expected to be shared with the Government because the\nwitness will testify for the Government. Instead, the client makes factual statements about the\nissue—not about the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communications—which the Government turns over to the\ndefense. See, e.g., In re General Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig., 8o F. Supp. 3d 52l, 528\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (“It is well established, houever, that the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege protects\ncommunications rather than information.”). The fact that “certain information might later be\ndisclosed to others does not, by itself, create the factual inference that the communications were\nnot intended to be confidential at the time they were made.” Jd. at 529 (emphasis in original,\ninternal quotation marks omited). In this case, it would have been improper for the Government\nto ask Jane hou Glassman had advised her regarding her decision whether to assist the\nGovernment.”\n\nSecond, Glassman did not waive any privilege over Jane’s communications with him\nthrough his comments to the Government. The reason is that Jane, not Glassman, was holder of\nthe privilege, and it was not Glassman’s to waive. See In re von Bulou, 828 F.2d at loo. And\n? United States v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3), on which the defendant relies (Def.\nLeter at 3), is inapposite. In that case, a company agreed to turn over certain documents to the\nGovernment “before the documents had been prepared.” J/d. at 493. Accordingly, the company\ncould not assert privilege over the documents, because they were made “for the purpose of relaying\ncommunication to a third party.” Jd. There is no reason to believe that Glassman’s legal advice\nto Jane was made with the intent to turn over that legal advice to the Government.\n\nS\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page6of8\nthere is no reason to think Jane expressly or implicitly authorized Glassman to waive her privilege\non the topic of Glassman’s advice to Jane about assisting the Government. Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the privilege — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived privilege. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> communication,” placed “the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span>\nrelationship directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her cooperation with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s compensation fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship into the trial by atempting to use privileged\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a privilege waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s privilege, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout cooperation. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”). The defense has other avenues to suggest that cooperating with the\n3 For these reasons, the cases cited by the defense are inapposite. (Def. Leter at 3-4). They concern\nvoluntary disclosures of privileged information. But Jane did not voluntarily disclose any\nprivileged information.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document536 Filed l2/lo/2l Page6of43 6\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl in my life, I think you can come to point of agreement, can't\n\n2 you?\n\n3 MS.

To the extent the\nanswers to Ms. Maxwell’s questions allude to any statements made by Carolyn, those statements\nare not confidential because they were made in the presence of, or with the understanding that\nthey would be disclosed to, a third party—the government. And all this testimony is relevant to\nestablish the timeline of Carolyn’s cooperation with the government and her motive and bias in\ntestifying against Ms. Maxwell, in particular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and\nuncooperative until there was the prospect of a payout from the EVCP.\n\nUnless put at issue by the government during cross-examination, Ms. Maxwell does not\nintend to ask Mr. Scarola any questions about any communications between Carolyn and Mr.\nScarola, or other employees working with Mr. Scarola, concerning the above referenced email or\nphone discussions between Mr. Scarola and the government.\n\nThe government has not met its burden of proving the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege applies.\nAny statements about forwarding messages to Carolyn were not made for the purpose of\nobtaining legal advice nor intended to be kept confidential.

Jane claimed to remember certain events happening in l994 because that was the year Mr.\nEpstein took her to see the Broadway production of The Lion King. As the atached email\nexchange between AUSA and Mr. Edwards shous, the government quickly recognized a\nproblem with Jane’s story because The Lion King did not premiere on Broadway until l997. Ex.\nl (35o9- olo). AUSA Rossmiller and Mr. Glassman then exchanged emails in which AUSA\nRossmiller tried to massage the problem and not-so-subtly invited Jane to change her story to say\nthat she had actually seen The Lion King movie, not the play. But Jane, through Mr. Glassman,\ndoubled doun, saying in response to AUSA Rossmiller’s email she saw the Broadway\nproduction of The Lion King, not the movie:\n\nBroadway play... Epstein bragged about being good friends with Julie Taymor, and\n\nwe had amazing first rou mezzanine seats they she had apparently given him.\n\nBx I,\n\nThere is nothing privileged about this evidence.

And any privilege that may have existed was waived\nwhen Mr. Glassman shared Jane’s statement with the government. See Fed. R.

During cross-examination, Jane\ndenied knouing that after the EVCP made its $5 million offer to setle, Mr. Glassman went back\nto the EVCP on her behalf to seek more money. TR at 558:8-l7. In fact, Mr. Glassman did\nexactly that. He originally demanded $25 million for Jane from Ms. Maxwell. Jane then filed a\nclaim with the EVCP, which offered $5 million. Mr. Glassman replied to the EVCP that Jane “‘is\na sophisticated claimant who knous the value of her claim is worth a lot more than $5 million.”\nMr. Glassman then demanded a setlement in the eight figures. Because Mr. Glassman\ncommunicated these demands to a third party, the first demand to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel and the\nsecond to the EVCP, and because these communications were not between Mr. Glassman and his\nclient, the exchanges are not protected by the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege and, even if they were, any\nprivilege was waived.\n\nFinally, there can be no argument that AUSA Rossmiller’s statements to Mr. Glassman,\nand Mr. Glassman’s statements in response, which do not repeat or refer to statements by Jane,\nare not privileged.

Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victims’ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendant’s approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating privileged, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” It is generally disfavored for a party\nat a trial to call an atorney as a witness against the atorney’s client, because doing so intrudes on\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship. Cf, e.g., l At’y-Client Privilege in the U.S. § 3:24 (2o2l)\n(“Although atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient relationship. ‘The serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.””); United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir.\nl975) (holding that the defendant may not call Government counsel as a witness unless “required\nby a compelling and legitimate need”); Edebali v.

(noting potential conflict of interest issues that arise if, for instance, “there is likely to be\nsubstantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe defendant seeks to call three atorneys for victims: Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and\nRobert Glassman. For each, the proposed testimony is either duplicative of facts already in\nevidence, is irrelevant or is improper impeachment. And in any event, whatever marginal\nprobative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion\nassociated with calling an atorney to testify against his client.\n\nA. Jack Scarola\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course\nof his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be privileged, it is\nirrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nMuch of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn\non cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the follouing facts:\n\ne Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2oo8 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims\n\nCompensation Program. (Tr. l6l7-l8).\n\ne Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2oo7 and March 2ol9, and then again\nwas out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2o2o. (Tr.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of9\nof a payout from the EVCP.” (Def. Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 BANISH\nSHEA &\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell appears to seek to compel Mr. Glassman to essentially\ncorroborate a statement in Ms. Moe’s email wherein she states “He also mentioned that he had\ntold her it would ‘help her case””.\n\nIn the unusual effort to compel a witness's lawyer to testify against his oun client, Ms.\nMaxwell claims that Mr. Glassman waived the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege. It is axiomatic that Mr.\nGlassman did not and could not waive the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privilege — only Jane could do that. To\nbe clear, Jane did not and does not waive the privilege in any way. And Jane does not authorize\nMr. Glassman to testify about any of his alleged communications with her.\n\nFurther, as a California atorney, Mr. Glassman is bound by California Rule of\nProfessional Conduct l.6. (Rule l.6 is atached hereto as Exhibit 2). Rule l.6 prohibits an\natorney from disclosing confidential information of the client except in two extremely narrou\ncircumstances. A California atorney may only disclose confidential information if: (l) the client\ngives informed consent, or (2) the atorney believes disclosure is necessary to prevent the client\nfrom commiting a crime that will cause death or grave bodily harm. Here, to the extent the\n“ther” in Ms. Moe’s email refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent. And Mr.\nGlassman obviously has no reason to believe that disclosing any alleged communication he gave\nminimum, distasteful and designed to intimidate the witness, and should be discouraged. But\nprocedurally, the appearance date on the subpoena is November 29, 2o2l - two days before he\nwas served - making it impossible for him to comply. Additionally, Mr. Glassman was not\nprovided with a witness fee or milage fee as required by Rule l7.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l2 of l7\n\nOn page 9 of the Claim Form, you must indicate which option you choose\nunder the \"Proof of Legal Representation/Legal Authority to Act on Claimant's\nBehalf\" section, and when you upload the claim, this documentation must be\nincluded in order to initiate the processing of the claim.

This\nCourt should either order her temporary release under l8 U.S.C. 3l42)\nor remand this mater and order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary\nhearing on the conditions of her confinement.\n\nIt is important to underscore that the government has made a\nnumber of representations to the trial court and to this Court about the\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention that have proven to be false.\n\nl. Government misrepresentation to the district court: “The\ndefendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance\ncaused by the flashlight [every fifteen minutes].” Doc. l96 (April 6, 2o2l,\ngovt leter to district court). But the truth is that she has no “eye mask”\nand the government has nou admited that eye masks are “contraband”\nin the jail and that she cannot have one. Doc. 27o (May 5, 2o2l, gov't\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020334.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 89-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Pagelo of l4\n\ngave to Ms. Maxwell contrary to MDC Brooklyn’s legal visit procedures\nwere confiscated by staff...” Doc. 259. Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers shoued this\nwas false and that they did not give anything to Ms. Maxwell. Doc. 258.\nIn addition, there was a videotape of the incident. But the government\nrefused to review it and refused to provide it to the court. The defense\ninsisted on having a hearing and that it be provided with the videotape\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> visit so that it could shou that the MDC statements\nto the government were false. The court declined to have a hearing or\norder the videotape turned over. The truth is actually out there. We\nsimply want an opportunity to demonstrate it at a hearing.\n\nIronically, the court then blamed the defense for failing to provide\nproof of its claims. The defense has, over and over again, requested\nhearings and that the videotapes of what is occurring in jail be produced.\nBut the district court said that the defense “describes generalized\ngrievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for\nrelief.” Doc. 282. This is an odd reason to deny Ms. Maxwell relief,\nespecially where even the government admits that guards flash a light in\nMs. Maxwell’s cell every l5 minutes and that she is not provided an eye\nmask.

Similarly, atorneys may not fax documents to inmates\nor to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.\n2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. §$54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassiqned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to Gisciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privileged calls. Inmates seeking\n<span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023755.jpg": "3 Emergency Telephone Calls\nInmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to 4a death\nor serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a\nrequest to the Religious Services Department.

The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability.

Atorneys who need to speak\nwith an inmate and do not anticipate that the inmate will call\nthem must visit the inmate in person or contact the inmate by\nleter. Similarly, atorneys may not fax documents to inmates\nor to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.\n2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. $54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not <span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privileged calls. Inmates seeking\n<span class=\"highlight\">atorney-client</span> privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023755.tif": "3.
