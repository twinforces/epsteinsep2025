This high level of political integration existing between the\nMember States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these\nStates in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the\nmember states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising\nfrom the European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and\nfrom the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from\nwhich France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Maters\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001202.jpg": "CaSese 2o-6f o S2osAd Ne niDoGcanteH) lo22l, ARB l2DF729ePage Hof 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\nDecember l8, 2o2o, Paris.\nResponse to the government’s memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s renewed\nmotion for release.\nI was asked to review the United States government’s memorandum and notably pages l5 to\nl7 alongside the French Minister of Justice’s leter dated ll December 2o2o produced as\nExhibit B to this memorandum.\nl The French Minister of Justice’s leter (Exhibit B)\nThe leter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that\nthe French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to\nthe United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which\nprovides that France can extradite \"any person not having French nationality”.\nIt remains unclear whether the author of such leter had actually access to my opinion which is\nnot even quoted, and more generally it seems the leter responds to a question which\nunexpectedly was not disclosed.\nThe leter fails to mention, houever, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions\nof the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence\nof an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure: “Jn the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the\nconditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this\nchapter'. These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an international\n<span class=\"highlight\">convention</span> stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France l996”, which supersedes French law\nas mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n56. Article 3(l) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a\nperson who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the\nUnited States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if,\nin its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought\nshall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n27 Tn French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordee : l° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite francaise, cete\nderniere etant appreciee a l'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\n28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure: “In the absence of an international <span class=\"highlight\">convention</span> stipulating\notherwise, the conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter.\nThese provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by international conventions”. (In\nFrench, « En l'absence de <span class=\"highlight\">convention</span> internationale en stipulant autrement, les conditions, la procedure et les\neffets de l'extradition sont determines par les dispositions du present chapitre. Ces dispositions s'appliquent\negalement aux points qui n'auraient pas ete reglementes par les conventions internationales »).\n° The Extradition treaty between the USA and France was signed in Paris on April 23, l996 and entered into force\non February l, 2oo2 (by Decree No. 2oo2-ll7 of 29 January 2oo2).\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l7\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l9 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n57. If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought, Article\n3(2) requires the requested State to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if\nso requested by the requesting State.\n\n58. Consequently, the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not\ncontain any prohibition on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it merely states that\nthere is no obligation upon the requested State to grant the extradition of a person who\nis one of its nationals.\n\n59. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA must therefore be distinguished\nfrom several international agreements on extradition ratified by France, which, by\ncontrast, contain a clear rule against the extradition of French citizens*?.\n\n6o. For example, France has made the follouing declaration pursuant to Article 6 of the\nEuropean <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on Extradition l957, which gives Contracting States “the right to\nrefuse extradition of nationals”:\n\n“Extradition shall be refused when the person sought had French nationality at the time\nof the alleged offence’.\n\n6l. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on\nExtradition”.\n\n62. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA is similar to other international\nagreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against the\nextradition of nationals. These are generally treaties signed with Common law\njurisdictions, which do not oppose the extradition of their nationals*’.\n\n3° See, for example, the Extradition treaty between France and Morocco, or the Extradition treaty between France\nand China.\n3! See France’s instrument of ratification of the European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on Extradition, deposited on lo February\nl986.\n32 The European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on Extradition l957 is an instrument of the Council of Europe which was signed in\nParis on December l3, l957 and came into force on April l8\", l96o. The European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on Extradition\nis open to signature by non-Council of Europe States, as such it was ratified by South Africa, Israel, and the\nRepublic of Korea. It was ratified by France on February lo\", l986.\n33 For example, the Extradition Treaty between France and Canada, signed in Otawa on l7 November l988,\ncontains a similar provision to the United States Treaty: “The requested State shall not be bound to extradite its\noun nationals. Nationality shall be determined as of the date of the offence for which extradition is requested”\n(Article 3).\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l8\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2o of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n63. The wording of these international agreements, which do not contain a prohibition on\nthe extradition of nationals, raises some important questions. In particular, could France\ndecide to extradite its nationals on the basis of these international agreements without\nviolating applicable international law, European law, or French constitutional law?\n\n64. In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus necessary to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) applicable international law, (i) European law, and (i) French\nconstitutional law.\n\n7) International law\n\n65. As outlined, international treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the principle constitutional status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the principle in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under international\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 22 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n73. The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions’). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’).

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By <span class=\"highlight\">convention</span>, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009466.jpg": "Case L28er8o68 PAE UN Bot Gmentlel6622 o lRildd BAIBA/ 22 ag Piagel4ie of ll7\nA-5862\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 2o of 29\n= Stephen Gillers\nLEGAL AND Reporter, Appellate Judges Conference, Commission on Judicial\nPUBLIC SERVICE participation in the American Bar Association, (October l99o-August .\nACTIVITIES l99l).\n(continued)\nMember, David Dinkins Mayoral Transition Search Commitee\n(Legal and Law Enforcement, l989).\nMember, Commitee on the Profession, Association of the Bar of the\nCity of New York (l989-l992)\nMember, Executive Commitee of Professional Responsibility\nSection, Association of American Law Schools (l985-l99l). :\nChair, l989-9o (organized and moderated Section presentation at\nl99o AALS <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> on proposals to change the ABA Code of\nJudicial Conduct).\nCounsel, New York State Blue Ribbon Commission to Review\nLegislative Practices in Relation to Political Campaign Activities of\nLegislative Employees (l987-88).\nAdministrator, Independent Democratic Judicial Screening Panel,\nNew York State Supreme Court (l98l).\nMember, Departmental Disciplinary Commitee, First Judicial\nDepartment (l98o - l983).\nMember, Commitee on Professional and Judicial Ethics, Association\nof the Bar of the City of New York (l979 - l982).\nBAR MEMBERSHIPS STATE:\n.

Ce haut niveau\nd’integration politique existant entre les Etats membres de ’Union europeenne va de pair avec une\ncertaine homogeneite, au sein de ces Etats, en matiere d’echelle des peines ainsi qu’en ce qui concerne\nles modalites d’amenagement de peine, les Etats membres etant lies par les memes obligations\ninternationales (notamment les obligations decoulant de la <span class=\"highlight\">convention</span> europeenne de sauvegarde des\ndroits de Phomme et des libertes fondamentales et de la jurisprudence de la Cour europeenne des\ndroits de ’homme).\n\nEn tout etat de cause, le principe de non-extradition des nationaux est un principe du droit\nde Pextradition auquel la France n’a jamais deroge en dehors du cadre de /Union europeenne.\n\nLe Chef du Bureau dce/A’Entride Pengle Intenationale\nPhilippe JAILG] 4°\nq ¢\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oloo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020102.jpg": "Casmai@Oicb8oRSoATbht DocumheiWeo , FIGE€SlBade4Bayel Spf 4\n\nArticle 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, l996 between the United\nStates of America and France stipulates that “The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition\nof any of its nationals, but the Executive Pouer of the United States has the right to do so at its\ndiscretion if it deems it appropriate.”\n\nIn application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under\nFrench law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American\njudicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to\nFrance.\n\nIt should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the\nUnited States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the\nterms of the Law of March 9, 2oo4 transposing the framework decision of June l3, 2oo2 on the\nEuropean arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused\non the sole ground of his French nationality.\n\nThis principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the\nEuropean judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between\nthe Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the\nMember States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these\nStates in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the\nmember states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising\nfrom the European <span class=\"highlight\">Convention</span> for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and\nfrom the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from\nwhich France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Maters\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020120.jpg": "Casmi@2O(c68oB3o.AobNt Docume W82l, FIEASB/2Bade6Rayel 2.nf 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\nDecember l8, 2o2o, Paris.\nResponse to the government’s memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s renewed\nmotion for release.\nI was asked to review the United States government’s memorandum and notably pages l5 to\nl7 alongside the French Minister of Justice’s leter dated ll December 2o2o produced as\nExhibit B to this memorandum.\nl The French Minister of Justice’s leter (Exhibit B)\nThe leter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that\nthe French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to\nthe United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which\nprovides that France can extradite \"any person not having French nationality”.\nIt remains unclear whether the author of such leter had actually access to my opinion which is\nnot even quoted, and more generally it seems the leter responds to a question which\nunexpectedly was not disclosed.\nThe leter fails to mention, houever, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions\nof the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence\nof an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure: “Jn the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the\nconditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this\nchapter'. These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).
