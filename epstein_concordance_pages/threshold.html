But even assuming arguendo that Petitioners’ rights\nunder the CVRA were violated when Epstein and the USAO-SDFL entered into the Non-\nProsecution Agreement, constitutional due process guarantees do not allou either the Non-\nProsecution Agreement — which by its terms induced Epstein to, inter alia, plead guilty to state\ncriminal charges and serve an l8-month sentence of state incarceration’ — or the governmental\nthis Court need not reach or address those issues because an analysis of the third prong of the\nstanding test incontrovertibly establishes the Petitioners’ lack of standing.

No federal charges involving Petitioners have ever\nbeen brought against Epstein, and no such federal charges have been resolved. The Non-\nProsecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal\ncharges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal\ncriminal charges against Epstein. Instead, when addressing potential federal criminal charges\nagainst Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely agreed in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that:\n\non the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Atorney for the Southern\n\nDistrict of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred\n\nin favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the\n\nfollouing conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth belou.\nand that\n\nAfter timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\nprosecution for the offenses set out on pages l and 2 of this Agreement, nor any\n\nother offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses\n\nthat arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this\n\nDistrict, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement at 2 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, the Non-Prosecution Agreement simply obligated the government not to prosecute\n\nEpstein in the Southern District of Florida for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution\n\n'© This Court has also previously described the Non-Prosecution Agreement as “an\nagreement under which .. . the U.S. Atorney’s Office would agree not to prosecute Epstein for\nfederal offenses.” DE 99 at 2-3.

Similarly, there is a high <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> in relation to injustice’,\nand it is very unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to meet it. There is a general presumption that\nJustice will be done despite the passage of time and the burden is on the requested person to establish\nthe contrary’. In assessing injustice, the appropriate judge would have regard to the procedural\nsafeguards that exist under US domestic law”. Further, the judge is very likely to place weight on the\nfact that Ms Maxwell had, in the hypothetical scenario under consideration, absconded from ongoing\nproceedings that would otherwise have resulted in her trial in the US. As the English High Court\nexpressed it in Zollman “the very fact that the accused invokes justice to prevent [their] extradition\nrequires consideration of the circumstances which have led to the fact that [they are] not facing\njustice in the country from which [they have] fled””°. In those circumstances it is very unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of passage of time to defeat extradition.\n\nForum\n\n32. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of forum, which applies where\nextradition would not be in the interests of justice because: (a) a substantial measure of the requested\nperson’s ‘relevant activity’ ”’ occurred in the UK; and (b) having regard to ‘the specified maters’””\nrelating to the interests of justice (and only those maters), the extradition should not take place”.\n\n33. Although some of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment is said to have occurred in\nLondon”, three of the ‘specified maters’ are likely to weigh heavily against a finding that extradition\nwould be barred by forum. First, it appears that the majority of the harm caused by the offending”\nalleged in the superseding indictment occurred in the United States. An extradition judge would treat\n\n°° Kakis at 784.

Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The decision in Love was based on section 9l of the 2oo3\nAct, and the court made no finding under Article 3 (para l23). In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span>” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 29\nspecific concerns, such as access to medical care”’. In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the treatment of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l7 of 29\nAnnex A — Questions set out in the Peters and Peters instructions dated l2 August 2o2o\nCounsel is instructed to prepare an expert opinion in respect of the follouing:\n\n(a) Outline the extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, including an overview of the general manner in which the arrangements work\nand the general timeframe for UK extradition proceedings in relation to requests from\nthe US.

Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Is Irrelevant to This Case\n\nThe defendant seeks to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (the “USAO-SDFL”). (Def. Mot. l). She does so despite the fact that: (l) she did not\nnegotiate the NPA, was not a party to the NPA, and her name is not contained anywhere in the\ndocument; and (2) her crimes are not identified or named in any way in the NPA. Essentially, the\ndefendant claims she is immune from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period,\nanywhere, in the United States, based on the language of a document that does not name her and\nwhich she did not sign. Moreover, she seeks to enforce the NPA against a U.S. Atorney’s Office\nthat did not negotiate the NPA and is not bound by it.\n\nThe defendant’s arguments are meritless, and the Court should reject them. As a <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span>\nmater, under the well-setled law of this Circuit, the NPA is not enforceable in this District,\nbecause the USAO-SDFL’s agreement with Jeffrey Epstein is not binding on the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York (the “USAO-SDNY”). Moreover, even if the NPA\napplied to this District—which it does not—the NPA does not immunize the defendant from\nprosecution for the crimes charged in the Indictment. Finally, because the defendant has failed to\n' As the Government has repeatedly indicated, the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s co-\nconspirators remains ongoing.

The same holds true here.\n\nIn support of her claim that she has standing to enforce the NPA, the defendant relies upon\nthree district court decisions, none of which analyzed the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> question of whether third party\nstanding concepts from contract law apply to plea agreements. In United States v. Florida West\nInt’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9, l228 (S.D.

In its analysis, houever, the court applied the doctrine without analyzing the question\nof whether third party beneficiary standing principles apply to plea agreements. /d. For similar\nreasons, the defendant’s reliance on United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo, 6o8-o9 (N.D.\nOhio 2ool) is misplaced. In that case, the court permited a third party to invoke a plea agreement,\nbut it did not analyze or address whether third party standing rules apply to plea agreements. /d.\nLikewise, in United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3 (D.S.C. l984), the court\napplied the third party beneficiary doctrine, but relied solely on contracts treatises for support, and\ndid not analyze whether that doctrine should be applied to plea agreements.\n\nIn any event, even if third party beneficiaries had standing to enforce federal plea\nagreements, the defendant has failed to establish that she is a third party beneficiary of the NPA.\nIn order to establish that she has enforceable rights under the NPA, the defendant must shou that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 239\n2ol8 respectively, would have testified, and that such testimony would have been exculpatory and\nwould have materially helped the defense.

The defense suggests that Casey\nnot having related any complaints about Maxwell to “any authority, Ms. Maxwell, or any other\nknoun witness” means that he knew of no complaints. (/d. at 9-lo).

Rajaratnam, No. o9 Cr. ll84 (RJH), 2olo WL 48674o2, at *l8\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2olo). The defendant fails to identify the standard that would govern such a\nhearing.

As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for discovery in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury conviction, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury.

Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\nsufficient to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 239\ncomparator is the jury eligible population of the five counties from which the White Plains Master\nWheel is drawn.\n\nThe American Community Survey (“ACS”) 2ol8 data indicate that the jury eligible\npopulation for the White Plains counties in 2ol8 was l2.45% Black or African-American and\nl4.l2% Hispanic or Latino.”? (See Siskin Aff. at § l9; see also Martin Aff. at § 2l).\n\nOnce the relevant comparators are defined, an additional <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> question is the statistical\nmethod by which to compare them. Courts have applied different approaches over time, such as\nthe statistical decision theory, the comparative disparity theory, and the absolute disparity theory.\nSee Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655. Although no method is perfect, see Berghuis v. Smith, 559 U.S. 3l4,\n329 (2olo), the Second Circuit has made clear that the comparative disparity theory is disfavored\nand strongly suggested that the absolute disparity theory is generally appropriate, see Rioux, 97\nF.3d at 655-56; see also United States v. Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“[T]he\nabsolute disparity approach is the primary approach used in this Circuit.”’).\n\nThe “absolute disparity” approach measures the absolute numerical difference between the\ndistinctive group’s representation in the community population and the group’s representation in\nthe relevant jury pool. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655; United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l, 3o-\n3l (E.D.N.Y. 2olo), affd 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir. 2ol2). For example, if Blacks\nrepresented lo% of the community population but only 2% of the relevant jury pool, the “absolute\ndisparity” would be 8%.\n\nThere is no specific numerical <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> that constitutes unacceptable disparity under the\n“absolute disparity” method. “[P]erfectly proportional representation is not required, since no\nThe American Community Survey gathers demographic information in between the decennial\ncensus, and is published by the United States Census Bureau.

In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO.

Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA.

At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 22\noutside the sentencing and immigration context in which the “necessarily entails” approach has\nbeen rejected, it fails to offer any.” Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by\nMs. Maxwell in which courts have interpreted “offense involving” language in a venue statute,\nwhich has nothing to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer to the\nelements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4)\n(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) 4 2 is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue.”) (emphasis in original); United States v.

Ala. 2oll) (“The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of\nSection 3237(a) when such transportation, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense\ncharged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a child”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 246 of 349\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings.

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\n<span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span>, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellof 4l\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> issue is, of course, whether the witness “is qualified to be an ‘expert’” in the\nsubject mater at issue.

Specifically, in Daubert, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence “assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.” 5o9 U.S. at 597. “Daubert applies to both\ndefense and government experts.” United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l48 (2d Cir. 2oo3).\n\nApplying Rule 7o2, the Court must determine whether the expert’s reasoning and\nmethodology underlying his testimony is valid, and whether that reasoning or methodology was\napplied reliably to the facts, so as to be relevant and helpful to the jury. See Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.\nl37. The reliability inquiry is flexible and “must be tied to the facts of a particular case.” Jd. at\nl5o (citations and internal quotation marks omited). The Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘t\nis critical that an expert’s analysis be reliable at every step.” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R.R. Pass. Corp.,\n3o3 F.3d 256, 267 (2d Cir. 2oo2). “In deciding whether a step in an expert’s analysis is unreliable,\nthe district court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies,\nthe method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and hou the expert applies the\nfacts and methods to the case at hand.” /d.

New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v.

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\n<span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span>, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page lo4 of l27 lo4\nLBl5max4\n\nl officer testifying as to what the officer himself found and\n\n2 participated in while executing a search seems to me\n\n3 permissible fact testimony.\n\n4 Anything to take up here from the defense,\n\nS Ms. Menninger?\n\n6 MS.

Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2—l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nII. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Threshold</span> for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page 8of2l\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nDkt. No. 462 at 24. In response to that question, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” not the box\nfor either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But in several public statements\nmade to media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The Independent and The Daily Mail\ndated January 5, 2o22, Juror 5o stated that he was sexually abused as a minor. The statements\nare direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 5o himself to multiple media outlets. Moreover, the\nstatements themselves describe Juror 5o’s oun experience.* They constitute “clear, strong,\nsubstantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has\noccurred,” and so warrant an evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n\nAlthough the Court does not decide whether the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> to hold a hearing based on\nQuestion 25 alone has been met, because the Court will hold a hearing on Juror 5o’s answer to\nQuestion 48 and because Question 48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire into\nJuror 5o’s answer to Question 25. Question 25 asked jurors:\n\nHave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime?\n\nDkt. No. 462 at l3. Again, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” and not the box for either “Yes\n(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But Juror 5o’s post-trial statements, if true, may\ndescribe criminal conduct of which he was the victim. Therefore, Juror 5o’s answer to Question\n25 is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will also inquire as to\nQuestion 25 at an evidentiary hearing. See Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n* The articles additionally state that Juror 5o shared this experience with the jury during deliberations. The Court is\nprohibited by Rule 6o6 from considering that Juror 5o also told this information to the jury. That Juror 5o revealed\nthat he also disclosed this information to the jury does not prohibit the Court from considering Juror 5o’s\nindependent statements made to a reporter about his oun experience.\n\n8\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9549", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o. And fourth, the screenshots proffered match Juror 5o’s description of his social\nmedia accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” /d. The <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9556", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nshort of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing.

Even if the Court considered Juror 5o’s statement about another juror,\nthe evidence would be insufficient to meet the high <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> for an inquiry.

Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s\nrequest that counsel directly question the juror—a decision commited to this Court’s “sound\ndiscretion.” Jd. at 667; see also Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544 (“We leave it to the district court’s\ndiscretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning the witnesses,\nand whether to hold the hearing in camera.”).

Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct disclosure would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5.

As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness.

Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively.

The Court should reject this invitation.\nThe defendant asserts that Shaoul’s holding that “a defendant must shou . . . that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer,” id. at 8l6, is dicta, claiming that Shaoul was decided on the second prong of\nthe McDonough test. (Dkt. No. 644 at l2). Not so. In Shaoul, the Circuit expressly affirmed the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the defendant “had failed to satisfy the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> requirement of the\nMcDonough test,” before concluding that he “also cannot satisfy the second part.” /d.; see, e.g.,\nPyet v.

United\nStates, 569 U.S. 53o, 532-33 (2ol3) (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is\nsentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the\ntime of the offense.”).\n\nThere is no dispute that the 2oo4 Guidelines, which took effect on November l, 2oo4,\ncall for a much harsher sentence than the 2oo3 Guidelines. If the Court applied all of the same\n! This memorandum sets forth arguments concerning the proper Guidelines calculation. Ms. Maxwell’s arguments\nfor why the Court should grant a substantial dounward variance from the advisory Guidelines range are addressed in\na separate submission entitled Sentencing Memorandum on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page ll of 29\nevidence indicates that Carolyn stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein at the latest\nin the summer of 2oo4, not in 2oo5.°\n\nThe two message pad slips cited by the government (GX 4-B, GX 4-F) do not support a\nfinding that the offense conduct lasted beyond November l, 2oo4.

Specifically, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to submit the grand jury transcripts and exhibits for in camera review, with the\nportions the Government proposed to redact highlighted. And it ordered the Government to file\na submission identifying the portions of the transcripts and exhibits, if any, that are not today\nmaters of public record, including based on Maxwell’s month-long jury trial on the charges\nreturned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government’s submissions in response to the Court’s orders were telling. They\nbelied the Government’s claim, in its motion to unseal, that the Maxwell grand jury materials\ncontain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the\ninvestigation into them. Two features of these materials, which were not disclosed in the\nGovernment’s motion, are noteworthy. The Court reports these here, at a level of generality that\ndoes not disclose the substance of grand jury proceedings.\n\nFirst, the grand juries in this case were not used for investigative purposes. They did not\nhear testimony from any firsthand witness to any event at issue. They did not hear testimony\nfrom any victim, eyewitness, suspect, or even a records custodian. The grand juries met instead\nfor the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l48", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\nredactions. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records.

The Relevant Factors Weigh in Favor of Granting a Stay of This Action.\n\nIn this instance, as discussed belou, the relevant factors support Maxell’s application for\na stay.\n\nl. Overlap Between the Civil and Criminal Cases\n\n“The strongest case for granting a stay is where a party under criminal indictment is\nrequired to defend a civil proceeding involving the same mater.” Volmar Distributors, l52\nF.R.D. at 39 (emphasis added) (citations omited); accord In re Worldcom, 2oo2 WL 3l7295ol,\nat *5. Denying a stay where there is significant factual overlap between the civil and criminal\ncases may “undermine a defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . . .\nexpand the rights of criminal discovery beyond the limits of Rule l6(b) of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure, expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution in advance of trial, or\notherwise prejudice the case.” Volmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 39 (citations omited); see also\nJohnson v. New York City Police Dep’t, No. olcv657o (RCC) (JCF), 2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. July l6, 2oo3).\n\nAs a <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> mater, this Court finds that, in this instance, there is significant factual\noverlap between this civil case and the pending criminal case. For example, as Maxwell points\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool945o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span>\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page/7 of 9l\nJuror's Statements (Dkt. 568) (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: ol/o5/2o22)\n\nol/o5/2o22 | 57l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell.

These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021529.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 353 3536o39, Page99 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 5 of 2l\n\nThe Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for\na hearing. Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2-l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)).

In response to that question, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” not the box\nfor either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But in several public statements\nmade to media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The Independent and The Daily Mail\ndated January 5, 2o22, Juror 5o stated that he was sexually abused as a minor. The statements\nare direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 5o himself to multiple media outlets. Moreover, the\nstatements themselves describe Juror 5o’s oun experience.* They constitute “clear, strong,\nsubstantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has\noccurred,” and so warrant an evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n\nAlthough the Court does not decide whether the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> to hold a hearing based on\nQuestion 25 alone has been met, because the Court will hold a hearing on Juror 5o’s answer to\nQuestion 48 and because Question 48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire into\nJuror 5o’s answer to Question 25. Question 25 asked jurors:\n\nHave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime?\n\nDkt. No. 462 at l3. Again, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” and not the box for either “Yes\n(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But Juror 5o’s post-trial statements, if true, may\ndescribe criminal conduct of which he was the victim. Therefore, Juror 5o’s answer to Question\n25 is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will also inquire as to\nQuestion 25 at an evidentiary hearing. See Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n4 The articles additionally state that Juror 5o shared this experience with the jury during deliberations. The Court is\nprohibited by Rule 6o6 from considering that Juror 5o also told this information to the jury.

Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023257.jpg": "have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023294.jpg": "As discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the <span class=\"highlight\">threshold</span> issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nl28 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\ned Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294"};
