Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000479.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 8 of 33 |\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).

Because of these efforts, Ms. Maxwell can nou\npresent the follouing additional information in support of her renewed bail application:\n\n¢ Leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse. This leter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has\npouerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the\ncommited relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, who ls a U.S citizen,\nand hou they lived a quiet family life together ira in the\nUnited States for over four years immediately prior to her arrest. The leter further\nexplains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public\neye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense\nmedia frenzy and threats follouing the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened\nthe safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, Ee For\nthese same reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse did not come forward as a co-signer at the\ntime of the initial hearing.

The\nsureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B-N, W-X).\n\n¢ Financial report.

In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial.

When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v.

See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing.

Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\nHampshire.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” /d.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.

The reference in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case.

[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page lo of 45\nNew Information for the Court’s Consideration\nThe defense has devoted substantial time and effort to compile information that was not\navailable to Ms. Maxwell at the time of the initial bail hearing that squarely addresses each of the\nfactors the Court considered at that hearing.

I not only got to knou the senior\nMaxwells but also got to knou very well their children including Ghislaine, since my age of l5.\nThough I was spending more of my time with the older siblings ee | also\nchose deliberately to spend time with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, who were soon going to prep school\ntogether during term-time. You need to knou that their father was narcissistic, highly controlling and\ndemanding as a father, and let them knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity.\nSo all the kids knew they had to “make it on their oun” despite the wealth and privilege in which they\nwere grouing up.\nAs I got to knou each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one\nworked very hard at their jobs, as neither parent, Bob nor Bety. would easily bear any idleness, and\neach strove for their father's and mother's respect through that their intelligence and that hard work. So\nit didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's and master's work at\nOxford, where she'd folloued her elder siblings, Ghislaine produced exemplary grades and a reputation\nas a serious student. I also noticed that personally, Ghislaine was quick-wited, full of initiative and\ngood humor, sincerely caring touards everyone she knew.\nI've maintained a fairly close relationship with the entire Maxwell clan for most of my life. I didn't\ncontinue to visit them regularly in England, but I stayed in touch by phone, especially with Philip,\nIsabel, Bety and Christine from l962 through the present. I spent time with Bety, Mrs Maxwell, as\nshe needed support, having suddenly been left after the death of Robert Maxwell. Later on, I wrote a\nbook explaining my gratitude to Bety for all she'd taught me about goodness and maturity. When she\nwas finally on her deathbed with Parkinson's in 2ol3, I was glad Isabel, who was caring for her, read\nher my book.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-ll Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3 of 3\nSo I am in a position to speak to Guislaine's <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. | had goten to knou her vital personality quite\nwell when she was young. And even though | wasn't in direct touch with her later on, all these Maxwell\nchildren are quite “tight” - they've always stayed closely in touch with each other. Thus whenever I'd\nspeak to any of her elders — Philip, Anne, Isabel and Christine, I'd also hear reports not just about their\noun lives and activities, but also Kevin's and Ian's, as well about Ghislaine's life. Her siblings\nconsistently reported for about a decade that she was enjoying life while starting her oun charity.\nSo what kind of a <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> is Ghislaine? I can testify without the least doubt that she is mature,\nsensitive, thoughtful, honest and, like all her siblings, strong-willed, determined and quite obviously\ngrounded in good human values. She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun opposition to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil accusations against her starting earlier. Nor do I have any doubt whatsoever that she\nfully intends to defend herself to the limit of her energy based upon her actual innocence and that above\nall she wants to go to trial and she is categorically not a flight risk.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l3 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 2\nl7 November, 2o2o\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v.

The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l4 of 22\nUnited States v.

See id. at 84:4-84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A-N, W-X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def.

Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3.

R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\ncircumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37, lo42-43 (2d Cir.l988); see also United\nStates v.

Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978) (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for\njoinder”).\n\nIn conducting a Rule 8(a) analysis, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish\n‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page ll of l9\naccusers were not part of the subject mater of the defamation action, nor were they deposed as\nwitnesses in that case.

Joinder is improper when the\noffenses are separated by such a significant time period and do not relate to each other. See\nMartinez, l993 WL 322768, at *8-*9 (joinder of firearm possession and narcotics conspiracy\ncounts improper under Rule 8(a) where firearm was seized in different location over four months\nafter narcotics conspiracy ended “under circumstances having no bearing on either the alleged\nnarcotics conspiracy, or any of [defendant’s] coconspirators”); Broun, 2oo8 WL l6ll46, at *5\n(joinder improper under Rule 8(a) where a firearm possession count was unrelated “both\nphysically and temporally” to narcotics counts in indictment (emphasis original)).\n\nThe Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts are also not “parts of a common scheme or\nplan.” Fed.

Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).\n\nAs shoun above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is irrelevant to the conspiracy counts.\nThus, to the extent that the government intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such\nevidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed. R. Evid.\nAo4(b).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2689\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document l82-2 Filed o3/26/2l Pageiofl\nCertificate of Good Standing\nI, JOHN A.

The Court should reject those arguments and permit the jury to resolve these issues of fact.\nVI. Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed\n\nThe Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse\nminors, and with commiting perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are\nproperly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a\ncommon scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second\njury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a\nsecond time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by shouing substantial prejudice from the\njoinder. She has not done so, and the severance motion should be denied.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) permits the joinder of offenses that “are of the\nsame or similar <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). This rule establishes three\ntests for joinder, each “reflect[ing] a policy determination that gains in trial efficiency outweigh\nthe recognized prejudice that accrues to the accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37,\nlo42 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nCharges are “similar” if they are “somewhat alike” or “hav[e] a general likeness to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. l98o) (internal quotation marks omited). “Rule 8(a) does not require\n‘too precise an identity between the <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> of the offenses.’” United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe perjury counts should be tried jointly with Counts One through Four. The offenses are\nof similar <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, are logically connected and will be proved through much of the same evidence\nbecause the perjury counts concern at least some of the same conduct relevant to the crimes\ncharged in Counts One through Four and, as such, are properly joined. See generally Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Severing the counts would waste judicial resources by requiring a second trial at\nwhich the Government would offer similar proof, including by calling the same victims of sexual\nabuse to testify again at a second trial. The defendant has identified no prejudice sufficient to\njustify imposing that burden on the victims, the Court, and the Government.\n\nFirst, the Government expects to prove the offenses charged in Counts One through Four\nand those charged in Counts Five and Six with much of the same evidence. See United States v.\nHester, No. l9 Cr. 324 (NSR), 2o2o WL 34837o2, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2o2o) (““Notably, the\nfact that evidence of the crime charged in one count may be admissible in the Government’s direct\ncase in the trial of the other will typically defeat the need to severe the counts.”). At trial, some of\nthe most critical evidence that the defendant commited the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four will also form the crux of the Government’s proof of the falsity of the defendant’s\ndeposition testimony. In particular, victim testimony and related evidence offered to prove the\nexistence of Epstein’s scheme to abuse underage girls, and Maxwell’s participation therein, will\nalso provide much of the evidence demonstrating the falsity of the statements charged in Count\nFive. Compare, e.g., Indictment § 4(c), (e) (discussing massages resulting in sexual abuse), with\nid. J 2l (denying interacting with underage girls and a denying a “scheme to recruit underage girls\nfor sexual massages”). Similarly, aspects of that proof, such as testimony regarding the sexualized\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 239\n“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”). The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y. R.P.C. 3.7(b); see generally Murray v. Met. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d\nl73, l77-8o (2d Cir. 2oo9) (discussing the advocate-witness rule).\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3llo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 239\nthe Court informing the jury that, to convict on any conspiracy count, it must find at least one overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute of limitations. See Benussi,\n2l6 F. Supp. 2d at 3o9 (describing a similar jury instruction provided for a conspiracy containing\nsome allegations that were time-barred and others that were timely).\n\nSecond, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. The references to “sexual abuse” accurately describe Minor Victim-3’s experience of\nsex acts with Epstein as traumatic, exploitative, and abusive, and she will testify to that effect at\ntrial. Moreover, because these acts were commited in furtherance of the criminal conspiracies\ncharged in the Indictment, it is neither misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity\ninvolved illegal conduct. More to the point, because evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 “‘is\nadmissible and relevant to the charge[s]” contained in Counts One and Three of the Indictment,\nthe language describing Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment “may not be stricken”\n“regardless of hou prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d at lol3 (quoting DePalma,\n46l F. Supp. at 797).\n\nFinally, even if Minor Victim-3’s experiences did not constitute direct evidence of the\ncrimes charged—which they do—this same evidence will also be admissible pursuant to Rule\n4o4(b) to prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nEvidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove\na person’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> in order to shou that on a particular occasion\nthe person acted in accordance with the <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>.

The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed.

Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page/7ofl7\n\nThe government also asserts, without explanation, that the Perjury Counts are of “similar\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span>” to the Mann Act Counts.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o). The alleged perjury in an unrelated defamation\ncase more than 2o years after the fact bears no likeness to allegedly enticing someone to travel\nfor an illegal sexual purpose.\n\nB. The Perjury Charges Do Not “Concern” the Mann Act Offenses.\n\nNor do the Perjury Counts “concern” the Mann Act Counts as claimed by the\ngovernment. Resp. l43. The government cites the supposedly “setled law in this Circuit that\njoinder of ‘underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts’ is appropriate ‘where . . . the false\ndeclarations concern the substantive offenses.”” Jd. (citing United States v. Potamitis, 739 F.2d\n784, 79l (2d Cir. l984)). But it is wrong on both the facts and the law.\n\nThe cases cited by the government involve a distinct fact patern: the defendant allegedly\nmade a materially false statement that relates directly to the underlying crime and the crime is\ntemporally related to the false statement. The Potamitis case that the government relies upon\nprimarily for this proposition is a good example. In that case, the defendant was charged with\nmaking false statements to FBI agents, commiting perjury before the grand jury, and obstruction\nof justice because he lied to the FBI agents and the Grand Jury about the underlying crimes for\nwhich he was being investigated and questioned. Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 786-87; see also United\nStates v.

There is no proper purpose for the\nadmission of any of the alleged perjury which occurred decades after the charges in Counts l-4. Certainly,\nthe government has articulated none. Ms. Maxwell’s answers to the vague and objectionable questions\nselectively plucked from hundreds of pages of transcripts have no relevance to any material issue related\nto the Mann Act Counts.

The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8.

MAXWELL'S COUNSEL UNDERSTANDS AND WILL FOLLOW THE\n\nRULES OF EVIDENCE AND PROHIBITION AGAINST ARGUMENT FOR\n\nJURY NULLIFICATION — RENDERING THIS MOTION MOOT\n\nThis motion in /imine, like most of the preceding ones, is another request that the parties,\nand the Court, abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence or that the Court offer an advisory opinion\nas to which types of evidence fall within the Rules. As described previously, supra at\nPreliminary Statement, these are inappropriate motions in /imine. It is unclear if the\ngovernment's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended\nevidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms.\nMaxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits\nor argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to\nthis case. Rule 4o4(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a defendant's \"pertinent trait,\" which, if\noffered, the government may rebut. Rule 4o5(a) permits evidence of a person's <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> or\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as\nto relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 6o8(a) permits a witness's credibility to be\natacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell\nand her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the\nprohibitions on encouraging jury nullification. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel will not argue to\nthe jury that they may acquit if they do not like that law. See United States v. Gardner, No. l6-\ncr-2ol35, 2ol6 WL 54o42o7, at *6-*7 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2ol6) (denying motion in limine\nregarding jury nullification. because, \"[a]t this point, it is unclear exactly what is included in the\ncategory of “evidence or argument that relates only to jury nullification.

Evid. 7o4(b).\n\nRule 4o3 demands exclusion when the probative value of evidence is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nAnd Rule 4o4 prohibits any witness, witness or lay, from offering evidence “of a person’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> or <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> trait . . . to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in\naccordance with the <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> or trait.” Fed.

Opinion l: Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern of\nbehaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature\nof the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser.\n\nl. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005673.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> in order to shou that on\n\na particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span>.\n\n(2) Permited Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(l)-(2). For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\nS\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5673\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor irrelevant under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b). See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l57-l69.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5679\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of8\n\nThe Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to\nintroduce at trial. It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial.

Simply put, if every word that Dr. Dietz said regarding the “Halo effect” and\nEpstein’s “brilliance” in exploiting it were taken as true, the defendant would be guilty if she met\nthe elements of the charged offenses—exactly as she would be if every word Dr. Dietz said on this\n3 Accordingly, even if the defense somehou put at issue whether a witness’s opinion on some\nmater was affected by hindsight bias—and the Government cannot currently envision hou this is\nlikely—the proper way of litigating an issue so squarely within the ken of the jury is through lay\nevidence and argument, not expert testimony.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 54\npouer to misapply the law.

MAXWELL'S COUNSEL UNDERSTANDS AND WILL FOLLOW THE\n\nRULES OF EVIDENCE AND PROHIBITION AGAINST ARGUMENT FOR\n\nJURY NULLIFICATION — RENDERING THIS MOTION MOOT\n\nThis motion in /imine, like most of the preceding ones, is another request that the parties,\nand the Court, abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence or that the Court offer an advisory opinion\nas to which types of evidence fall within the Rules. As described previously, supra at\nPreliminary Statement, these are inappropriate motions in /imine. It is unclear if the\ngovernment's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended\nevidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms.\nMaxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits\nor argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to\nthis case. Rule 4o4(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a defendant's \"pertinent trait,\" which, if\noffered, the government may rebut. Rule 4o5(a) permits evidence of a person's <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> or\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as\nto relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 6o8(a) permits a witness's credibility to be\natacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell\nand her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the\nprohibitions on encouraging jury nullification. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel will not argue to\nthe jury that they may acquit if they do not like that law. See United States v. Gardner, No. l6-\ncr-2ol35, 2ol6 WL 54o42o7, at *6-*7 (E.D. Mich.

Opinion l: Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern of\nbehaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature\nof the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser.\n\nl. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses.

For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor irrelevant under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

Minor Victim-3 will not be\nasked to testify about a legal conclusion, nor will she do so. She will simply describe her factual\nexperience.

To be clear, the admissibility of Accuser-3’s testimony about is a separate topic that has been\nseparately briefed and argued.

Moreover, to the extent the\ngovernment is seeking to introduce Accuser-3’s evidence to shou Epstein’s sexual preference for\n“young girls”—which would include women who are young, but still above the age of consent like\nAccuser-3—that would mislead the jury and invite them to convict Ms. Maxwell based on a moral\njudgment of sexual activity which, in the case of Accuser-3, was entirely legal.\n\nSecond, Epstein’s “sexual preference” is impermissible propensity evidence that is\ninadmissible under Rule 4o4(b). Epstein’s alleged “sexual preference” is evidence of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. By its oun admission, the government wants to use Accuser-3’s testimony to prove this\naspect of Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and argue that he acted in accordance with this <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> with the\nother Accusers.

As previously argued, Accuser-3’s evidence does not shou that Ms. Maxwell\nknew Epstein engaged in sexualized massages with underaged girls. See November 5 Ltr. at 7-8.\nAt most, it establishes that she allegedly knew that he engaged in sexualized massages with adult\nwomen.

The government suggested to us that we must avoid any\npublic mention of: (l) names of people, places, or specific addresses or locations; (2) particular\ndates of career events or life events; (3) names of any employers, particular performances, or\ncharacters played; (4) specific details of story arcs in any performances played; (5) references to\npublicly available information or publicly available records that contain a pseudonymous\nwitness’s real name; and (6) court filings or other court documents.\n\nRespectfully, the government’s proposal is overly broad and unworkable.\n\nWe are mindful of the Court’s orders on this topic, and we have no objection to many of\nthe government’s suggestions—e.g., the names of people or specific addresses or particular\nemployers. But the government’s proposal reaches much too far, and it would unfairly constrain\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to meaningfully and effectively confront her accusers.

The Government\nproposes the follouing addition to the limiting instruction the Court is already planning to give\nbefore Witness-3 testifies.\nYou will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she\nhad with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was\nover the relevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she\nsays occurred with Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government\nhas charged in the Indictment. For that reason, I have directed the parties not to\nask Witness-3 about the details of any sexual conduct she says occurred with\nMr. Epstein. | instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged\nin the Indictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the\nissues before you, you may consider it. Houever, you may not convict the\nDefendant on the basis of the testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this\nwitness and Mr. Epstein. Nor may you consider this testimony as any kind of\nreflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> or propensity to commit\nany of the crimes charged in the Indictment.\nThis addition to the proposed instruction is neutral but mitigates the risk of prejudice to the\nGovernment.\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: ___s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: Defense Counsel (by ECF)\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 2l of 24 33\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl conspiracy and so forth.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> of the evidence, not the\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009249.jpg": "Case PAECIOOS8O-PAEUBOOUEA AN O45 Filedawwye4/2agePagee 27 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

They have supported each other’s careers --\nwhen Theresa found a beter position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody\nto move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and community.

David relates to each child\nindividually and gives each a chance to play. When a boy with severe disabilities was on the\nbasketball team, David “made sure every other boy ... went out of [his] way to ... help him\nmake a basket before the end of the season.” Id. As one observer notes, David’s “measured,\npersonal approach contrasts markedly with the loud cacophony typically employed by [those]\n... who atempt to coach [children’s] sports teams.” Leter of Charles Austerberry.’\n\nWhat may best reflect David’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> is his commitment to his friends. In their\nleters to the Court, many of them recount stories of David’s support in their times of need. See\ne.g., leter of Bridget Rodgers (when I was pregnant and “told I had an infection that would cause\nOne parent whose child is a gifted athlete writes this about David:\n\nThe thing that has endeared me most to Dave is the way he\n\ncoaches the boys in basketball.

Discussion\n\nNo constructive amendment or variance occurred in this case. The grand jury returned the\nS2 Indictment charging the defendant with knouingly transporting Jane with the intent that Jane\nengage in criminal sexual activity in New York, and aiding and abeting the same, and with\nconspiring to entice and transport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York. That is the core of criminality charged in the S2\nIndictment, and it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury\ninstructions.\n\nl. The Proof at Trial and Jury Instructions Captured the Core of Criminality\n\nThe defendant argues that the core of criminality for the Mann Act counts “was a scheme\nby Epstein and [the defendant] to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the\nintent that they would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.” (Def. Mot. at 9).\nThat is precisely the theory the Government advanced at trial.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page5lof 77\nISABEL MAXWELL\nll42o SANTA MONICA BLVD #25424\nLOS ANGELES, CA 9oo25\n\nMay l8, 2o22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page 2of2l\ninformation concerning the background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch. For every favor or promise of a favor, sexual\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo693\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Page3of2l\nactivity was demanded in return. And soon the sex overcame everything else. Sarah described the\nEpstein/Maxwell quid pro quo as the “Hotel California;” you can check-out any time you like, but\nyou can never leave.\n\nBoth VISs provide relevant background information regarding Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and\nconduct. Both statements further describe that for many years after finally extricating themselves\nphysically from the Epstein/Maxwell trap, they suffered serious mental and physical illnesses.\nElizabeth discusses numerous hospitalizations for mental breakdouns and being unable to hold\ndoun a job. After being a victim of Maxwell’s conspiracy crimes, Sarah atempted suicide twice, both\ntimes ending up in the hospital with serious physical injuries.\n\nBoth Sarah and Elizabeth have submited VISs to the probation office for inclusion in the\nPresentence Investigation Report. See Declaration of Robert Y. Lewis, dated June 23, 2o22.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should allou Sarah and Elizabeth to read their\nvictim impact statements at Maxwell’s sentencing hearing.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. These Victims Have a Statutory Right to be Heard Under the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\nThe Crime Victim's Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e). This definition was based on earlier restitution statutes which “all demonstrate a clarion\ncongressional intent to provide restitution to as many victims and in as many cases as possible.”\nUnited States v. Martin, l28 F.3d ll88, ll9o (7th Cir. l997) (quoted in United States v. Kamuvaka,\n7l9 ESupp.2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2olo)). In relying on these far-reaching statutes to craft the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo694\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 _ Filed o6/25/22 Page6of2l\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sarah and Elizabeth are categorial “victims” who should be alloued to\nspeak at sentencing. Sexual abusers frequently use their actual or perceived pouer to manipulate and\ncoerce victims during their abuse or trafficking. Jill Laurie Goodman & Dorchen A. Leidholdt,\nLawyers Manual on Human Trafficking, NY State Jud. Comm. on Women in the Court l69-76\n(2ol3). The scheme Sarah and Elizabeth both describe in their victim impact statements is the same\nscheme Maxwell is being sentenced for and it involves the same defendant and co-conspirators as the\nconspiratorial scheme proven at trial.\n\nMoreover, these victim statements reflect Sarah’s and Elizabeth’s personal knouledge of\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and actions in furtherance of the scheme. Maxwell’s argument that Sarah and\nElizabeth do not qualify as real victims because they were not minors at the time of the trafficking\nand therefore are not victims within the counts of conviction is of no moment. The allegations in the\nsecond superseding indictment easily encompasses these non—minor victims. For example, in\nparagraph 4(e) of the second superseding indictment, which is a sub-part of a count for which there\nwas a conviction, alleges that “through this process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage\nin sexual activity with Epstein.” Likewise, paragraph 9 of the second superseding indictment alleges\nthat “among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, were\nminor victims identified herein as Minor Victim—l, Minor Victim—2, Minor Victim—3 and Minor\nVictim—4.” A fair reading of the indictment is that although it emphasizes minor victims, the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy—as alleged—encompassed non—minor victims like Sarah and Elizabeth.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 _ Filed o6/25/22 Page9of2l\n\n[at sentencing] broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may\nconsider, or the source from which it may come come.”); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 24l, 247\n(explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate sentence” judges need “the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not\nlimit the evidence that the court can consider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. llol(d)(3); United\nStates v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d l23o, l24o (D. Utah 2oo4); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2,\n8l3 (loth Cir. l995). See also United States v. Cofteld, No. l7-CR-6lo, 2ol9 WL 487933l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2ol9). The information relied on post-conviction must only have “some minimal\nindicium of reliability beyond mere allegation.” United States v. Shine, No. l7-CR-28-FPG-JJM,\n2o2o WL 32937, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, 2o2o) quoting United States v. Juwa, 5o8 F.3d 694, 7ol\n(2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the expansive pouer of federal courts at sentencing is\na broad federal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which establishes that “xo limitation shall be placed\non the information concerning the background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of a person convicted of an\noffense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court\nextremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about\nMaxwell’s “background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and\nElizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized the broad scope of this provision. In United States v.\nMorrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5), the Second Circuit noted that section 366l\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pageloof2l\ncontains “emphatic language” which “preclude|s] categorical proscriptions on any factor concerning\nthe background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of invidious\nfactors.” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(en banc)).\n\nAdditionally, there is nothing in section 366l limiting sentencing information to individuals\nwho meet the CVRA’s definition of being directly and proximately harmed by the offense. See\nDegenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d l34l, l343 (D. Utah 2oo5). Federal judges have broad discretion to\nallou “affected individuals to present information to the court at sentencing.” United States v,\nGamma Tech Industries, Inc., 265 F.3d 9l7, 924 (9th Cir. 2ool). See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.\n24l, 245 (l949).\n\nAt least one federal court of appeals has considered the situation where a person provided\ninformation to the sentencing court even though the defendant objected that the individual did not\nmeet the CVRA’s definition of victim. In United States v. Leach, 2o6 Fed. Appx. 432, 2oo6 WL\n32o3746 (6th Cir. 2oo6) (unpublished), the court, while sentencing the defendant to felon-in-\npossession of a firearm, alloued the defendant’s estranged wife to be heard. She told the court that\nthe defendant was a dangerous man who had threatened to kill her. The Sixth Circuit held that the\nsentencing court possessed discretion to hear from the wife under section 366l. The Court explained\nthat the CVRA “did not alter (or, more importantly, limit) a district court’s traditional broad\ndiscretion to consider a wide variety of factors at sentencing.” /d. at 434.\n\nThese authorities clearly support the principle that this Court has broad unlimited discretion\nin sentencing Maxwell to hear from anyone it believes will have relevant information. Sarah and\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagelilof2l\nElizabeth respectfully submit that hearing their unique “information concerning the background,\n<span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct” of Maxwell will assist the Court in imposing a fair and just sentence.\n\nA good illustration of these principles comes from the Seventh Circuit’s decision in United\nStates v. Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of conviction but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy.

In support of\nthis motion, the undersigned states as follous:\nINTRODUCTION\nAt trial of Ghislaine Maxell, Kate testified about her experience with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe jury found that Maxwell had commited crimes charged in the indictment beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Nou, at sentencing, the Court has greater freedom to consider the full scope of the harms\nthat Maxwell’s crimes have caused. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l (“no limitation shall be placed on the\ninformation concerning the background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Kate seeks to assist the Court in that effort by providing an oral victim\nimpact statement at sentencing.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010742.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68l-l Filed o6/26/22 Page6of7\nconsider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. llol(d)(3); United States v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d\nl23o, l24o (D. Utah 2oo4); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2, 8l3 (loth Cir. l995).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the broad pouer of courts at sentencing is a broad\nfederal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which states “no limitation shall be placed on the\ninformation concerning the background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words “no limitation” grant a sentencing\ncourt extremely broad discretionary authority over what sentencing information will be\nconsidered. The Second Circuit, for example, has recognized the broad scope of this provision.\nSee United States v. Morrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5). The Second Circuit noted that\n§ 366l contains “emphatic language” which “preclude[s] categorical proscriptions on ‘any\nfactor concerning the background, <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of\ninvidious factors.’” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l\n(2d Cir.2oo8) (en banc)).\n\nIn view of these authorities, the court has discretionary to hear from anyone it believes would\nhave useful information for sentencing. Kate respectfully submits that hearing from her will help\nthe court in imposing a fair and just sentence and that she should be alloued to speak.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the Court should allou Kate to deliver an oral victim impact statement\nat defendant Maxwell’s sentencing, or, at a minimum, provide her additional time to brief the issue.\nDated: June 22, 2o22.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Page2of4\n\nThe Defendant contests whether the remaining four individuals—Maria Farmer, Sarah\nRansome, Teresa Helm, and Juliete Bryant—are “crime victims” within the meaning of the\nCVRA.

So to the degree\n\nthat um there was a main facilitator that started the whole thing, it was Ghislaine.\n\n3 A purported transcript of the press conference is contained on the internet at\nhtps://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/announcement-transcript-of-charges-against-ghislaine-\nmaxwell-in-new-york-jeffrey-epstein-associate-arrested.\n\n* htps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-\nepstein/2o2o/o7/o2/2oc745o2-bc69-l lea-8cf5-9clb8d7f84c6_story.html\n\n> htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDK Hdzix2k\n\nApp.o34\nDOJ-OGR-oool9493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019867.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN ISdtuM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P a hag e426ioLo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

Because of these efforts, Ms. Maxwell can nou\npresent the follouing additional information in support of her renewed bail application:\n\n¢ Leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse. This leter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has\npouerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the\ncommited relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, who ls a U.S citizen,\nand hou they lived a quiet family life together ira in the\nUnited States for over four years immediately prior to her arrest. The leter further\nexplains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public\neye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense\nmedia frenzy and threats follouing the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened\nthe safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, Ee For\nthese same reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse did not come forward as a co-signer at the\ntime of the initial hearing. (Ex. A).\n\n¢ Leters from numerous other friends and family members. These leters from\nMs. Maxwell’s other sureties and several family members and friends atest to Ms.\nMaxwell’s strong, forthright <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> and their confidence that she will not flee. The\nsureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B-N, W-X).\n\n¢ Financial report. The financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins\nLimited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell’s financial condition from 2ol5-\n2o2o, and discloses (i) all of her oun assets, (ll) all assets held in trust, and (ll) all of\nthe assets held by her spouse over that same time period. The report reflects that the\ntotal value of assets in all three categories is approximately $22.5 million, which is\nthe amount of the proposed bond. (Ex. O).\n\n* Report from former IRS agent. a a former IRS agent with over 4o\nyears of experience in criminal tax and financial fraud investigations, reviewed the\nMacalvins report and confirmed that it presents a complete and accurate picture of\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets from 2ol5-2o2o.

(Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “<span class=\"highlight\">character</span> . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020141.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehBaSo/Ptag Page fLaosf 22\nUnited States v.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\nemployment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">character</span>. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing.

(quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na <span class=\"highlight\">character</span> that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance ls not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021731.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page84 of 93\n7l\n\nalleged in the indictment.” United States v.

At no\npoint during the trial, including its summation, did the\nGovernment argue that the jury could convict on a the-\nory that Maxwell intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico. Similarly, the District Court’s charge required\nthe jury to decide whether Maxwell intended to violate\nNew York law.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ...

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ...

After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating 2 plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\nEpstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission.
