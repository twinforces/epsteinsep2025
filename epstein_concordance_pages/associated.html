Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4) (affirming district court order\nof pretrial release of defendant, a resident and citizen of Denmark-from where defendant\ncould not be extradited-charged with bulk cash smuggling and forfeiture, noting that the\n\n” This Court’s opinion in Zarrab stands only for the proposition that wealthy defendants should\nnot be provided an unfair advantage. It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA.

On July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York returned\nan indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2. On August lo, 2ol9,\nwhile awaiting trial, Epstein commited suicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center\nin New York City. Soon after, the Court dismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52.\n\n2. On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, l:2o-cr-33o, Dkt. No. l (S.D.N.Y. June 29,\n2o2o). In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts.

Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nDe On July 6, 2o25, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\nannounced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since\nthen, the public’s interest in the Epstein mater has remained. Given this longstanding and\nlegitimate interest, the government nou moves to unseal grand jury transcripts <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nEpstein.\n> The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v.

Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are\nsubstantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of\nJustice will work with the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nto redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release.\n\n6. For these reasons, this Court should conclude that the Epstein and Maxwell cases\nqualify as a mater of public interest, release the <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> grand jury transcripts, and lift any\npreexisting protective orders.

Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. /d. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

This morning was a very joyful and tearful filled\nmorning, it was a wonderful moment in my journey with these survivors, to be\n\nable to call them and tell them that the one person’s who’s been out in the public\n\nwithout being held accountable was finally in prison....She was really, Ghislaine\n\nwas really the central figure, so she worked hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein to\n\nbe able to facilitate these crimes over the course of more than two decades; and\n\nshe was the main person who assisted him and alloued him to be able to\n\nperpetrate so many crimes against young females.\nThese comments violate subsections (6) and (7) of the Rule.\n\nIt appears that given any opportunity lawyers <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the prosecution of this case\nwill offer any opinion that damages Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity for a fair trial.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6. There has been no alienation of any assets in the period 2ol5-2o2o other than\nexpenditure in the ordinary course of family life and more recently since 2ol9 very\nsubstantial expenditure on professionals engaged in the defense of Ghislaine\nMaxwell from the criminal charges she faces.\n\nl7. In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash\nfrom 2ol5 through 2o2o are covered by this report of financial condition without\nexception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\nl8. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell. This mater was resolved by the year\nend of 2ol7 without diminution of assets.\n5|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l5 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 8 of lo\n\n24.

In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 26\nclaims about Ms. Maxwell because of the passage of time.° A review of the media coverage of\nthe Epstein story reflects an unwarranted transformation of Ms. Maxwell from Epstein friend to\nEpstein conspirator. This re-casting by the media has no basis in fact but is the cumulative effect\nof publishing or republishing untrue assertations about Ms. Maxwell.\n\nHad the government brought any charges against Ms. Maxwell in l996-2oll it (a) would\nhave not prevailed and (b) none of the accusers would have been able to conform their\n“memories” to the often republished “obvious lies.”\n\nVII. The Reckless, Tactical, or Bad Faith Delay.\n\nThere is no legitimate justification for the extraordinary delay <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this\nprosecution. Tactical, reckless, and bad faith motives can reasonably be inferred from the way\nthe government has ignored evidence, delayed any prosecution, enlisted partisan lawyers to do\nits bidding, circumvented established precedent to illegally obtain evidence, and misleadingly\nquoting banal testimony so that it could be labeled “perjury.” And, after having done so,\nprejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial by improper extrajudicial statements.\n\nA. Abuse of the Civil Litigation Process to Gain a Tactical Advantage.\n\nAs detailed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her Motion to Suppress all\nEvidence Obtained from the government’s Subpoena to J and to Dismiss Counts\nFive and Six, Ms. Maxwell was involved in lengthy, intrusive, and contentious litigation with\n® A simple Google search for the name “Ghislaine Maxwell” on January l3, 2o2l yielded 5,l4o,ooo results in o.56\nseconds.

Instead, this information, crucial to whether an underlying\nviolation of § l3o.55 could have occurred at all, remains “shrouded in mystery.” See\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575.

United\nStates v. Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997) (emphasis omited). Ms. Maxwell is therefore\nleft to guess hou she allegedly perjured herself, as charged in Counts Five and Six.

As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation.

(Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 239\n\nto determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” J/d.; see, e.g. United\nStates v.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'% Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l.

The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

This\nmethod has been shoun to significantly improve the estimation for Hispanics. !°\n\n27. There is one constraint on the accuracy of the geocoding methodology. The basic\nassumption is that if the potential voting eligible population (U.S. citizens of voting age) ina\ncensus tract is 85% African American, then we would expect 85% of those on the master jury\nwheel who reside in that census tract to be African American. Houever, since the master jury\nwheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this\nassumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract\nis the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to\nregister to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans\nand Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason l). Houever, there is no valid statistical\nevidence to conclude there is such a difference.\"!\n\n28.

The questions posed to Ms. Maxwell were\npoorly phrased without regard to the rules of evidence. Accordingly, counsel for Ms. Maxwell\nwas required to object many times. As this court knous, civil litigants are limited to three types\nof objections: form, foundation, and privilege. When those objections are posed, the examiner\nhas the opportunity to ask for the basis of the objection. It is not incumbent, indeed it is not\npermited, for the objecting lawyer to expound on the basis for the objection unless asked.\nVirtually all of the questions that form the basis of Counts Five and Six were the subject\nof valid objections. A prerequisite to use of deposition testimony at trial is that the testimony\nmust be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence as if the deponent were present and\ntestifying. Fed. R. Civ.

It is unlikely that any\nof the answers would have been admited at any trial.\nII. The Questions Were Fundamentally, and Fatally, Ambiguous\nIn addition to being poorly phrased, the questions were unquestionably ambiguous.\n“TW |hen a line of questioning is so vague as to be “fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support\n[a] perjury conviction.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367 (2d Cir. l986); see also United\nStates v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). “Precise questioning is imperative as a\npredicate for the offense of perjury.” Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). “A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous when it is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of\nordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a\nquestioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as\ntestimony.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (cleaned up). Here, the questions were “fundamentally\nambiguous,” containing particular undefined terms, “scheme” and “recruit” for example.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury conviction. The courts holding is equally applicable here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352 (l973), makes clear that an individual cannot be\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo372l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003974.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page3ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll4 of 349\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender ....” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l29 of 349\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou. Can I persuade you to atend?”\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4426", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l32 of 349\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'° Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses.

EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.

In fact,\nundersigned counsel and Ms. Maxwell’s trial team have been very careful to keep the\nrepresentation separate. I have not been provided any of the trial discovery.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v. State Bar of\nNevada, 5ol U.S. lo3o, lo74 (l99l) (stating that “lawyers representing clients in\npending cases may be regulated” by substantial prejudice standard and not\nheightened general First Amendment standard of clear danger) (emphasis added); id.\nat lo76 (“The regulation of atorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that\nis substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect ... applying equally to all\natorneys participating in a pending case’) (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument.

Dkt. No. 3o9.\n\nMr. Markus is plainly a lawyer <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the defense in this case. His formal\nrepresentation has involved handling at least one pre-trial issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular,\nappeals to the Second Circuit of this Court’s bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. l73; see also\nUnited States v. Maxwell, Nos. 2l-58-cr(L), 2l-77o-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held\nhimself out as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the\nop-ed at issue in the Government’s leter application, which describes him as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” He has also atended a proceeding in this mater and spoken on Ms.\nMaxwell’s behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney.

Dkt. No. 3l4. Rule 23.l is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the\nrule limits its application to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary,\nas the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others)\n“<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with “pending or imminent criminal litigation.” S.D.N.Y.

An atorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently\n“<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial\nstatements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess\ninformation that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold\ngreater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. l982); see also People v. Butafuoco,\n599 N.Y.S.2d 4l9 (Nassau Cty. Ct. l993).\n\nSuch is the case with Mr. Markus’s role in the pending mater. As noted, Mr. Markus has\natended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell’s behalf.\nHe has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court’s pre-trial bail determinations.\nMoreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer in a published\nop-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which\nincludes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information\nregarding the pending mater and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable.\nMr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and\nthe Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity\nwith respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4963", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 _ Filed o7/3o/2l Page3of3\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that “presumptively involve a substantial likelihood\nthat their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due\nadministration of justice within the meaning of the rule.” S.D.N.Y.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nPursuant to the Court’s order, dated August l3, 2o2l, we respectfully submit this leter to\ninform the Court that Ms. Maxwell does not seek any redactions to the Court’s sealed Opinion and\nOrder, dated August l3, 2o2l, or the underlying motion papers.\n\nWe note that, under the terms of the Protective Order entered in this case, defense counsel\nare prohibited from “filing publicly as an atachment to a filing or excerpted within a filing the\nidentity of any victims or witnesses referenced in the discovery, who have not spoken by name on\nthe public record in this case.” (Dkt. 36 ¥ 6). The underlying motion papers reference the names\nof accusers and potential witnesses who have spoken on the public record in this case and others\nwho have spoken publicly but not <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> themselves directly with this case. The Court has\nruled that the existence of the Protective Order, by itself, is not sufficient to justify redactions, and\nthat any redactions must be justified under the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other\nwitnesses who have chosen to speak to the media about their alleged experiences, including\nregarding the very materials sought by the subpoena, should be publicly disclosed and that it is not\nthe defense’s burden to justify redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seek any\nredactions. If the government wishes to seek any redactions, we respectfully submit that it is their\nburden — not Ms. Maxwell’s — to justify them under Lugosch.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5oo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 58 of 6o\nfurther discuss the claim.

These details are “inflammatory” in light of the “nature of the conduct alleged.” Order\nat 32, United States v. Raniere (May 6, 2ol9), Dkt. No. 622. Minor Victims-l through -4 are\nexpected to testify in explicit detail and/or be the subject of highly sensitive and personal\ntestimony concerning illegal sexual abuse by the defendant and Epstein, much of which occurred\nwhile they were under the age of l8. While Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 will not testify,\nsimilar details are expected to be elicited as to them. These details will likely appear in the news\nand on the internet, but the Court can ensure that they will not be publicized side-by-side with\nthe victim’s true name. See Order at 2-3, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8,\n2ol7), Dkt. No. 34 (“This case has already received significant national and local press coverage.\nRevealing Jane Doe’s identity would likely cause her anxiety and risk social stigma.”).\n\nSecond, the publicity increases the personal and professional consequences to the Minor\nVictims for testifying. One Minor Victim has expressed substantial concern to the Government\nabout the risks that her association with this case will pose to future employment. Making that\nassociation widely public—for that victim and others—requires the Minor Victims to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the graphic details of their experiences, not just in the general public\nconsciousness, but with their friends, families, colleagues, and prospective employers.\n\nThird, the publicity increases the risk that the Minor Victims will be harassed by the press\nand public.

Publicizing their names will subject them to unwanted atention at the time they\nare testifying in a criminal sex abuse trial.‘\n\nTaken together, requiring the Minor Victims to testify under their true and full names\nimposes serious costs on them. It is inconsistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act’s\nexhortation that victims are to be treated with respect for their “dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). And requiring victims of sex crimes to provide their names in public could chill\ntheir willingness to testify, for fear of having their personal histories publicized as they rebuild\ntheir lives. See Order at 2, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7), Dkt. No.\n34. It could also cause other victims—including minors—to avoid seeking help from law\nenforcement because of fear that coming forward could subject them to further harassment and\nembarrassment. Cf Fed.

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way.

As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof relevance in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 4o\nprivate rather than public,” which avoids “catering” to “sensational” interests. (Gov’t Mot. at l6\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995); United States v. Cohen, 366\nF. Supp. 3d 6l2, 626-627 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (alterations and internal quotation marks omited)).\nThis limited sealing request is significantly protective of the interests of the Minor Victims, who\nwere sexually abused as minors, and minimally burdensome to the public. See Paris, 2oo7 WL\nl484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim identities outweighs the public\ninterest in access to information because “the public and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’\nand Minors’ testimony in full’); cf. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9 (d)(2) (permiting any papers that disclose\nthe name of a child to be filed under seal without the necessity of a court order). !”\n\nAlthough the defense argues that this request is “contrary to well-established Second\nCircuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor of access\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with public dissemination of records that are already shared publicly at trial. See United\nStates v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l49 (2d Cir. 2ool); Application of National Broadcasting Co.,\n635 F.2d 945, 95l-52 (2d Cir. l98o). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies\nfor evidence submited under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of\ncourt was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at l49 (quoting Application of National Broadcasting\nCo., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared\nin open court, so these cases are inapposite.\n\nTo the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at\n22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\nconspiracy to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\nirrelevant, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(summary order) (“Further, the victims could not consent because they were minors.”).\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo559l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005630.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of24\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves to exclude the proposed testimony of Lisa M.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 45\nDisclosure Paterns in Child Sexual Abuse l63\nIn reviewing the literature on this subject, London and colleagues (2oo5)\nnoted, ‘when children do disclose, it often takes them a long time to do so’ | “When children do\n(p. 2o4). disclose, it often takes\nthem a long time to do\nReasons for Paterns of Delay, Partial Disclosure and Non-disclosure so”\nThere are many influences on disclosure that have been identified in the\nresearch literature to help explain why it is that children delay disclosure, are\nreluctant to disclose, provide details of their experiences over time or do not\ndisclose at all.

No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofl5\n\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 3\nprofessional publications.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6256", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately.

Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil).

We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6 of 29\n\nloo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 29\n\nll4 J. Engle and W. O’Donohbue\n\nbetween reports of childhood trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.\nSanders & Giolas, l99l). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the\nrelationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with memory distortions. In an effort to align\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6288", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and suggestive questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 29\nll8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “...

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way.

As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts.

See Paris, 2oo7 WL\nl484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim identities outweighs the public\ninterest in access to information because “the public and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’\nand Minors’ testimony in full’); cf. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9 (d)(2) (permiting any papers that disclose\nthe name of a child to be filed under seal without the necessity of a court order). !”\n\nAlthough the defense argues that this request is “contrary to well-established Second\nCircuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor of access\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with public dissemination of records that are already shared publicly at trial. See United\nStates v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l49 (2d Cir. 2ool); Application of National Broadcasting Co.,\n635 F.2d 945, 95l-52 (2d Cir. l98o). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies\nfor evidence submited under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of\ncourt was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at l49 (quoting Application of National Broadcasting\nCo., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared\nin open court, so these cases are inapposite.\n\nTo the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at\n22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6537", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\nconspiracy to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\nirrelevant, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\nDetective Recarey—is dead.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 45\nDisclosure Paterns in Child Sexual Abuse l63\nIn reviewing the literature on this subject, London and colleagues (2oo5)\nnoted, ‘when children do disclose, it often takes them a long time to do so’ | “When children do\n(p. 2o4). disclose, it often takes\nthem a long time to do\nReasons for Paterns of Delay, Partial Disclosure and Non-disclosure so”\nThere are many influences on disclosure that have been identified in the\nresearch literature to help explain why it is that children delay disclosure, are\nreluctant to disclose, provide details of their experiences over time or do not\ndisclose at all.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week.

No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive literature\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the literature about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with those\n22 stages. So they did a very comprehensive literature review.\n23 They identified a number of specific behavioral and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the literature.\n25 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page5ooofl58 5o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact. And then\n3 beneath each stage level, there is a list of the behavioral and\n4 the observable and measurable behaviors where there was a high\n5 level of statistical significance in agreement among varying\n\n6 professionals as to the relevance both to the grooming process\n7 and to the stages.\n\n8 Q. I want to direct your atention to Page 4. What is this\n\n9 table?\n\nlo A. So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of\n\nll about 77 specific behaviors that have been found <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\n\nl2 with grooming in the literature fairly consistently. These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming. I think this is another way that provides some\n23 validation of a proposed model of the ways in which grooming\n24 works.\n25 MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull that doun.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l3 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive literature\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the literature about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with those\n22 stages. So they did a very comprehensive literature review.\n23 They identified a number of specific behavioral and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the literature.\n25 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 5l of l595o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact. And then\n3 beneath each stage level, there is a list of the behavioral and\n4 the observable and measurable behaviors where there was a high\n5 level of statistical significance in agreement among varying\n\n6 professionals as to the relevance both to the grooming process\n7 and to the stages.\n\n8 Q.

So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of\n\nll about 77 specific behaviors that have been found <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\n\nl2 with grooming in the literature fairly consistently. These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming. I think this is another way that provides some\n23 validation of a proposed model of the ways in which grooming\n24 works.\n25 MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull that doun.

Sure. I think that certain things -—- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\nke behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't\n4 at all reference the scientific literature to determine what is\n5 and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that —- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

And in any event, whatever marginal\nprobative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with calling an atorney to testify against his client.\n\nA. Jack Scarola\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course\nof his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be privileged, it is\nirrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nMuch of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn\non cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the follouing facts:\n\ne Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2oo8 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims\n\nCompensation Program. (Tr. l6l7-l8).\n\ne Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2oo7 and March 2ol9, and then again\nwas out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2o2o. (Tr.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of9\nof a payout from the EVCP.” (Def. Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 39 of 82\nl offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abeted, counseled,\n2 commanded, induced or procured that person to commit the crime.\n3 As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has commited the crime\n4 charged.

Typically, a defendant receives time-served credit\nfor each day incarcerated prior to sentencing. Pretrial detainees have received and continue to\nreceive credit beyond time served for detention during COVID. See, e.g., Gonzalez; Brisset,\nsupra. Ms. Maxwell should receive a hardship credit in addition to a COVID credit due to the\nrestrictive and harsh conditions of her pretrial detention.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is not an heiress, villain, or vapid socialite. She has worked hard her\nentire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the\nworld. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently\nis assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat. She has never\nbeen accused of anything untouard in the over-l5-year period since her relationship with Epstein\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo482", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 49 of 77\nGhislaine is educated and hard-working. She found her passion in life at aged 5o, when she poured\nher heart and soul into seting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The\nTerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and\npublishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities\nand organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.\nThese recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,\nwhich is hou they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each alloued their logos/names to be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\non the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her\nconcern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close doun the\nProject was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be\nvilified by the Press after her arrest. I knou that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways\nto give back to society.\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’\nsocial position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms\nwith gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her\npositions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to\nget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work\nwas a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every\ntime they reference her.\nIam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain\nfreedom while she still has all her faculties, [ knou she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest\nof what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the\npoints in my leter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her\ntruly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\nRespectfully,\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\nll42o Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 76 of 77\nPorensic-Psychiatric Report\nGhislaine Maxwell\nFORMULATION\n\nMs. Maxwell ts a 59-year-old Caucasian woman, who ls being evaluated at the request\nof her atorney in order to assess her current mental state and risk of flight.\n\nMs. Maxwell has consistent described, and complained formally of, being subject to\nunfair and inconsistent treatment by correction officers and ongoing sleep deprivation\nthroughout her incarceration.

Due to a medical\nissue, Ms. Farmer is unable to atend the sentencing in person, therefore she respectfully requests\nthat the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allou her atorney representative\nSigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.\n\nStatement by Maria Farmer:\n\nMy life was on a trajectory to be a well-knoun and well-respected artist when I was\nderailed by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was studying with the phenomenal artists Eric Fischl and Chuck\nClose, while doing art for Director James Brooks when I was held captive and assaulted by Jeffrey\nEpstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on the Wexner estate in l996. I was freshly graduated from a\nMasters program in Art—something I worked touards all of my life. Ghislaine began threatening\nmy life and destroying my livelihood follouing my return from being falsely imprisoned at\nWexner’s.\n\nShe wasn't happy just destroying my career, she also assured me my future was destroyed\nand she did everything in her vast pouer to accomplish this goal. She threatened my family and\nfriends.\n\nI have severe PTSD and two cancers as a result of my forced solitude, poverty, and quality\nof life while in hiding.\n\nThe shame I <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with my art follouing Ghislaine's abuse was overwhelming. I\nstopped painting. The thing is, this was never my shame to carry. I was a figurative artist doing\nwhat artists do, paint. The beholders of my art, Epstein and Maxwell, perverted it into what they\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfllp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo672", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675-2 Filed o6/25/22 Page3of5\nMaxwell put me on a strict Atkin's diet while simultaneously sending me to a psychiatrist who\nprescribed anti-depressants (among other drugs I did not need) that caused weight gain.\n\nIt was a classic no-win situation, and they knew it, precisely what human traffickers seek. I\nnever lost the weight, my application was never good enough, and it never got submited.\n\nI thank Almighty God that, in 2oo7, I managed to escape the horror by fleeing for my life to\nthe UK.\n\nSince then, I have been coping with the daily all-consuming fear that someday Epstein and\nMaxwell would harm me, my loved ones and my family, as Epstein repeatedly told me would\nhappen, if I ever dared to leave.\n\nI frequently experience flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares reliving the\nawful experience. I am hypervigilant, experience dramatic mood changes, and avoid certain places,\nsituations and people. I will sometimes start crying uncontrollably and without apparent reason. I\nhave worked hard with several mental health professionals who have diagnosed me with extreme\nsymptoms of anxiety, depression, lou self-esteem, PTSD, and tendencies to self-harm.\n\nDespite my earnest eftort, I have not realized my God-given potential professionally or\nentered healthy personal relationships. I have never married and do not have children, something\n\nI always wished for, even as a litle girl.

For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with devices and documents\nand photographs <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata.

That\nsupplement was untimely. Thus, we intend to object at trial to the admission of any opinions\nfrom Mr. Flatley not included in your September l5, 2o2l disclosure. This supplement for\nMr. Kelso does not purport to respond to anything contained in your Flatley supplement.\n\nWe anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the meaning of certain pieces of\nmetadata <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with computers and computer files, such as “Authors,” “Last saved by,”\n“Registered Organization,” and “Registered Owner” and potentially others. Mr. Kelso will\ntestify about where the data contained in these types of metadata fields originates and hou it\npropagates. Mr. Kelso will testify that a particular value in one or more of these metadata\nfields, such as a version of person’s name, does not necessarily mean that person authored the\nunderlying documents or had any interaction with the documents. This testimony may cover\nany exhibits offered by the Government.\n\nMr. Kelso's testimony may also encompass the metadata <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with defense\nexhibits, including testimony about the values contained in certain metadata fields and their\nmeaning. Because the defense cannot anticipate at this juncture which exhibits may be\nnecessary, depending upon evidence offered by the government during its case in chief, the\ndefense reserves the right to disclose the metadata testimony from Mr. Kelso at the same time\nit identifies any particular exhibit that it will introduce as impeachment or rebutal exhibits.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of8\nwitnesses using pseudonyms or first names, and to redact or seal certain exhibits, as a further\nmeasure to protect the identities of the four Minor Victims. The Government did not argue that\nthose witnesses merited pseudonyms on their oun, but rather that they needed derivative\nanonymity to protect the Minor Victims.\n\nNumerous other witnesses testified at trial for the Government under their true name,\nincluding those closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the defendant and Epstein, such as Larry Visoski, Juan\nAlessi, David Rodgers, and Nicole Hesse. And the Government did not seek anonymity for a\nnumber of other witnesses the Government ultimately did not call at trial.\n\nThe defendant nou seeks anonymity protection for three lay witnesses, none of whom are\noffered to testify as victims of sexual abuse: a. Michelle Healy, and i.\n\nIll. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion should be denied for two reasons. First, it seeks anonymity for\ncategories of witnesses that courts generally have not previously permited to testify with their\nidentities protected. Second, the defendant’s request does not implicate her right to a fair trial or\nto present a defense.\n\nFirst, none of the defense witnesses satisfy any of the established categories of witnesses\nwho courts have permited to testify under pseudonyms. The defendant does not even suggest that\nPo fits into any such category. (Def. Leter at 8-9). Indeed, the defense concedes\n' The Government also offered a large number of exhibits under seal or in redacted form. Those\nrequests largely, if not entirely, concerned (l) witnesses whom the Court permited to testify using\npseudonyms or under their first names; (2) personal identifying information, such as addresses; (3)\ninformation related to third parties, that is, individuals who are not testifying at trial or at issue in\nthe case; or (4) exhibits where information for testifying witnesses was co-mingled with private\ninformation so extensively that redactions were impractical.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of8\nthat “[t]here is no allegation that I is a victim of any improper or illegal conduct by Mr.\nEpstein or Ms. Maxwell” and offers no suggestion that [i would face any particularized harm\nshould she testify under her true name. (Def. Leter at 8). She is no different from the several\nGovernment witnesses who were closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Maxwell and Epstein who have already\ntestified under their true names. There is accordingly no legal basis for i to testify under a\npseudonym.\n\nFor Michelle Healy, the defendant claims that she is the same Michelle who, on cross-\nexamination, Jane recalled participating in sexualized massages with her and Epstein after Jane\nreached the age of consent and moved to New York.” On this theory, which the Government\ndisputes, the defendant claims Healy is a victim-witness entitled to the same solicitude as the\nvictims who testified in the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Leter at 7-8). The defendant’s\nposition is misplaced. First, the defendant has not established that Healy is the same Michelle that\nJane referenced in her testimony. Indeed, the Government anticipates filing a separate motion to\npreclude Healy’s testimony in part because there is an insufficient basis to find that Healy’s\ntestimony would in fact contradict Jane’s.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, it appears based on the defendant’s Rule 26.2 disclosures that Healy\nwill testify that she was not a victim of Epstein and the defendant. (Presumably, if she were, the\ndefendant would not be calling Healy.) Unlike the Government’s victim-witnesses, then, Healy’s\ntestimony will contain no explicit details about sexual abuse, her dignity and privacy are not at\nThe Gaverment disputes ffs characterization of Jane’s testimony: Jane testified on cross-\nexamination that a “Michelle” participated in those massages, not that Michelle Healy did so.\nDefense counsel chose not to ask for a last name or otherwise atempt to identify to which\n“Michelle” she was referring.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page7of8\nfront of their friends, families, and communities. For instance, Government cooperators and\nconfidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their cooperation with the\nGovernment made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\nresistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be\npublicly <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury. See l8 U.S.C. § l62l. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be\ninterviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do so. And\nthe Government has the same pouers and limitations. Put simply, the defendant’s constitutional\nrights are not infringed if this Court follous the same rule as every other court in every other trial,\nhigh profile or not.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government should be instructed that it cannot\ndiscuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.\n\nSimilarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-l to\n“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear\nto be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. United\nStates, 344 U.S. 6o4 (l953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 44o (l949). The government\nnou seems to concede this point, falling back on the time honored “effect on the listener” and\ntherefore not offered for the truth of the mater exception to the hearsay rule. The problem with\nthe government’s position, houever, is that the statement and subsequent actions are not relevant\nto any material issue in this case. The apparent point of the proffered evidence is to demonstrate\nthat, in 2oo5, Epstein was extracting his computers in advance of the search and thus may have\nhad some guilty knouledge. Ms. Maxwell is not charged with tampering or obstruction and\nEpstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-l to do something with his computers is not\nrelevant to whether Ms. Maxwell conspired to do the things alleged in the indictment. Again, any\nprobative value <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell who was not present, did not participate, and had no knouledge of either the statement\nor the acts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll286", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Said the\ngovernment:\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the\nforensic examination of the devices marked for identification as Government\nExhibits 54 and 55, and his determination that those exhibits are clones. He is\nexpected to testify that a clone is an exact copy of one piece of media to another.\nExaminer Flatley is expected to explain that he connected Government Exhibits 54\nand 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact copy, of the\nexhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices\nbecause he ran a hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on\nthe original devices and the images, which are identical.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that\nGovernment Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for\nGovernment Exhibits 55 and 54, respectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that\nsuch registry software information includes several fields, including registered\norganization and registered ouner, which are user input data. He is expected to\nexplain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data AD\nLab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that\nhe examined certain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55. In particular, he is expected to testify that\nGovernment Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails on Government Exhibit 54;\nGovernment Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on Government\nExhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is\nexpected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created\nunder a user profile named “gmax.” He is also expected to testify that Government\nExhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on Government Exhibit 55.

Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release.

Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4. Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator’s receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant.

Sure. I think that certain things -- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\n3 behaviors are considered grooming.

In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judoments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that -- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability.

Given the public interest in the\ninvestigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\ninto Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury\n! htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 785 _ Filed o7/l8/25 Page2of4\ntranscripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other\npersonal identifying information.” The Department will work with the United States Atorney’s\nOffice for Southern District of New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related\ninformation and other personal identifying information prior to releasing the transcripts.\nTransparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect\nvictims.\n\nl. On July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York returned\nan indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See United States v. Epstein, l:l9-\ncr-49o, Dkt. No. 2. (S.D.N.Y.). On August lo, 2ol9, while awaiting trial, Epstein commited\nsuicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. Soon after, the Court\ndismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52.\n\n2. On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See Dkt. No. l. In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several\ncounts. This Court sentenced Maxwell to 24o months’ imprisonment and the Second Circuit later\naffirmed her convictions and sentence. See United States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nDe On July 6, 2o25, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\nannounced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since\nthen, the public’s interest in the Epstein mater has remained. Given this longstanding and\nlegitimate interest, the government nou moves to unseal grand jury transcripts <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nEpstein.\n\n2 The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v. Epstein, l:l9-cr-49o (S.D.N.Y,), and in the\nSouthern District of Florida.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o38", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 785 _ Filed o7/l8/25 Page4of4\nshould end.” /d. Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are\nsubstantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of\nJustice will work with the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nto redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release. While the Government recognizes\nthat Maxwell’s case is currently pending before the Supreme Court on a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, it nonetheless moves this Court for relief due to the intense public scrutiny into this\nmater.\n\n6. For these reasons, this Court should conclude that the Epstein and Maxwell cases\nqualify as a mater of public interest, release the <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> grand jury transcripts, and lift any\npreexisting protective orders. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo5 (“It is ... entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.”).\n\nRespectfully submited,\nPAMELA J.

Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\nae oe\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

The doctrine is based on the\ndistrict court’s supervisory authority over the grand juries it empanels. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at\nlo2 & n.2. It today is recognized in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not elsewhere.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special circumstances’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe disclosure;\n\n(i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 84l (8th Cir. 2oo9); Pitch v.\nUnited States, 953 F.3d l226, l24l (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 624\n(2o2o). The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its historical importance), and In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 3l4, 33o-36\n(D.D.C. 2ol8) (ordering disclosure of some grand jury materials related to the investigation of\nPresident Clinton’s business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern), with In re\nShepard, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 37, 39-4o (D.D.C. 2oll) (denying as overbroad request for disclosure\nof all testimony and materials <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with every witness before three Watergate grand juries),\nand In re Nichter, 949 F. Supp. 2d 2o5, 2l2-l3 (D.D.C. 2ol3) (denying disclosure of certain\ngrand jury records about Watergate because at least one subject of the testimony was still alive).\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015237.jpg": "D.

Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nApp.o32\nDOJ-OGR-oool949l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019495.jpg": "CGsedl ZDaO S BOs ATTEN (hdc WRG 2o2 F i62l /PAg eethei6l 257\nThe Honorable Alison J.

On the other hand,\n\nthe arrest and conviction that would come from a plea deal is an enormous step\n\nand I think they also recognize that Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell did not act alone.\n\nThere are lots of other people that need to be brought to justice.\n\nMcCawley: I think that the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have\n\ndone an incredible job and they’re being very meticulous, they want to make sure\n\nthat the Indictments stick. ...They took a lot of time to be very careful and\n\nthoughtful and that gives me a lot of hope that she will remain in prison for the\n\nremainder of her life. ... This morning was a very joyful and tearful filled\nmorning, it was a wonderful moment in my journey with these survivors, to be\n\nable to call them and tell them that the one person’s who’s been out in the public\n\nwithout being held accountable was finally in prison....She was really, Ghislaine\n\nwas really the central figure, so she worked hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein to\n\nbe able to facilitate these crimes over the course of more than two decades; and\n\nshe was the main person who assisted him and alloued him to be able to\n\nperpetrate so many crimes against young females.\nThese comments violate subsections (6) and (7) of the Rule.\n\nIt appears that given any opportunity lawyers <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the prosecution of this case\nwill offer any opinion that damages Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity for a fair trial. Entry of an order\nprohibiting extrajudicial statements, therefore, is a necessary remedy to avoid further\ndissemination of prejudicial information.

Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Several days later, more than $l4 million was transferred from that account into\nanother account opened in the name of the defendant.” In short, the defendant’s financial resources\nappear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her\ntotal financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to\nthe Government.\n* The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring\nbetween 2oo7 and 2oll, approximately more than $2o million was transferred from accounts\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the defendant, including amounts in\nthe millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nEpstein.\n\nPi\nDOJ-OGR-oool987l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019895.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDdSSCUAUIN DstamteHPl &-Pitdd B77 POH Page St 2o\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’). In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn connection with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9. It is unknoun whether the defendant purchased the\nproperty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019915.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL8) 26a deanfect 2 GP l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v.

Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b).

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021287.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3536o38, Pagell5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “TI enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021302.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l38 3536o38, Pagel3o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have ...a lot of victims... lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nTel Villatafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'® Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this case. ...

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021306.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office .. . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\nl6s In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses.

EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023060.jpg": "also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n43 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\na Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023125.jpg": "this mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023140.jpg": "that it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges.

Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span.

She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, ““Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.' Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this case... .

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB.

Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers.

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDe EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements. Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate\n27 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,”\nnot “codes.”\n\n42\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023426.jpg": "a part of his job, and he would allou inmates to place telephone calls if they were unable to make calls\nunder ordinary circumstances.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that at approximately 6:45 p.m., he and Senior Officer Specialist l escorted\nEpstein from the atorney conference room to the SHU so that Epstein could place a telephone call. The\nUnit Manager said he put Epstein in the shouer area to make the telephone call because COs were present\nin that area. The Unit Manager explained that he also chose the shouer area because that location ensured\nEpstein would not be able to pull the phone cord into his cell and use it to harm himself. The Unit Manager\nsaid he plugged the telephone line into the legal line, which was not recorded, and dialed the telephone\nnumber that Epstein provided. As noted above, the number that was dialed was in the local 646 area code.\nThe Unit Manager said he alloued Epstein to place the telephone call on the unrecorded legal line because\nhe believed that Epstein had not set up his Inmate Telephone System account that would have alloued him\nto call on the institutions recorded lines. According to the Unit Manager, a male answered, and the Unit\nManager handed the receiver to Epstein. The Unit Manager heard Epstein say, “Hey, hou are you doing?\nHou's everything?” The Unit Manager admited that he should have verified who was on the line, as Epstein\nhad requested to make a telephone call to speak with his mother, and it was a male who answered the\nphone. The Unit Manager said he could not verify the phone number because he believed that Epstein did\nnot have his Inmate Telephone System account set up, and he did not have any phone numbers <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\nwith his account. The Unit Manager told the OIG that after he handed the telephone to Epstein, his shift\nended so he left the SHU and left MCC New York for the day.\nThe Unit Manager said that when he left the SHU, Epstein was still on the call and the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Noel were at the officers’ desk, and that Senior Officer Specialist l was also present.\nAccording to the Unit Manager, when he was leaving, he told the officers, “Hey, make sure he gets his l5-\nminutes, and after that, he’s done.” The Unit Manager said he did not provide the SHU staff with\ninstructions to monitor the call. He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and\nasked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up.\nThe Unit Manager acknouledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done. The Unit\nManager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to\nbring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front. The\nUnit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member\npresent, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored.\nThe OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to\npublic records, died in 2oo4. The OIG found that Epstein actually spoke with Individual l, who declined to be\ninterviewed by the OIG.*? Individual l’s lawyer told the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of\nNew York during an atorney proffer that Individual l spoke with Epstein on August 9, 2ol9, at about 7 p.m.,\nfor approximately 2o minutes. Individual l's atorney proffer was that Individual l was in the country of\nBelarus at the time of the call.** Individual l’s atorney told the U.S. Atorney's Office that during the\n33 The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not Department of\nJustice employees.\n* The OIG did not investigate the factual accuracy of this proffer.

He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality <span class=\"highlight\">Associated</span> with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions.

The undersigned counsel went out\nof his way to make certain Mr. Epstein would not be in the building after the time the deposition\nwas sef to begin. Had the Plaintiff and her counsel been in the deposition room at the appointed\ntime, no visual contact would have occurred. )\nl5. It is possible that Plaintiff's counsel, by filing their motion for protective order on\nSeptember 9, 2oo9 and then advising the undersigned on September l4, 2oo9 that the deposition\n- would not go forward unless the undersigned agreed to exclude Mr. Epstein from the deposition, |\nwere not prepared and/or did not want to proceed with the deposition. :\nl6.

The deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 was to\nbegin at l:oo p.m, based on her schedule, and was moved from the undersigned’s office to the\noffice of the court reporter at her counsel’s request.\n\nPursuant to Rule 3o(d)}{2} and (3)(A) and (C) and its reference to 37(a)(5)), Federal Rules | |\nof Civil Procedure, the court may impose an appropriate sanction, including reasonable expenses |\nin atorneys fees incurred by any party on a person who impedes or delays the fair examination |\n\nof the deponent. In this instance, the brief visual encounter, which was completely unintended |\n\nand inadvertent, should not have been grounds for Plaintiff's counsel and Plaintiff refusing to :\n\nmove forward with the deposition. Furthermore, pursuant to (3)(A} and (C), Plaintiff and .\n\nPlaintiffs counsel had no right to unilaterally terminate/cancel the deposition and fail to move\n\nforward.

Jeffrey\nhas been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scientific\norganizations. Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n. At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n2 The Jeffrey Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. and the C.o.U.Q.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023060.tif": "also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n33 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\n34 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023125.tif": "this mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, ““Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl4 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023140.tif": "that it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have .. . a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou. Can I persuade you to atend?”\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023143.tif": "whether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, ““Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'® Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023144.tif": "appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added).

Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.tif": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.””? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o9 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n278 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023251.tif": "she would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.’?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.

Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span>\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day.

If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which\nwould be even more of a restriction to him.\nRe: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8 % yrs. of\ndoing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no knoun case where a Sex Offender on\nCommunity Contro! has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or\nDOC. There have been rare instances where a person who has been on a very long probation has been given\nearly termination of probation after serving a considerable number of years on probation.\nRe: The position of the U.S. Atorney’s office on early termination of the State’s case against Epstein, | again\nspoke with AUSA Villafana and inquired specifically of any knouledge that she had in reference to\nrepresentations made by her or anyone <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with her office regarding Epstein’s efforts to early term his\nCommunity Control on the State charges. She indicated that she had not made any such representations\nhouever her boss, interim U.S. Aty. Sloman may have. After checking she sent me a portion of the last leter\nsent to Epstein’s atorneys. | have forwarded that to you by atachment.\nPlease let me knou if there is anything else that | can provide to you.\nFrom: Villafana, Ann Marie C. (USAFLS) [mailto:Ann.Marie.C.

Mr. Epstein and his counsel may_not make a\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\n3/26/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033228.tif": "disciplined in business and conscientious. A man always quick to help\nsomeone who is doun, or to offer an opportunity to someone to pursue a\ndream or a goal.\n\nGenerosity to Educational. Wellness, Civic and Scientific Organizations. Jeffrey\nhas been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scientific\norganizations. Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n° At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been <span class=\"highlight\">associated</span> with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n?
