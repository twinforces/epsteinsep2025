The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment.

For the due\nprocess reasons already discussed above, the United States must legally abide by the terms of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement even if this Court should somehou set the agreement aside for\nPetitioners to consult further with the government atorney handling the case. Moreover, as will\nbe explained in greater detail belou, see infra at 8-l2, Petitioners already have the present ability\nto confer with an atorney for the government about a federal criminal case against Epstein —\nwhether or not the Non-Prosecution Agreement is set aside — because the investigation and\npotential federal prosecution of Epstein for crimes commited against the Petitioners and others\nremains a legally viable possibility.°\n\nThe present proceedings under the CVRA must accordingly be dismissed for lack of\nstanding because Petitioners simply have no injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable\nruling in these proceedings.

The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000349.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page /7oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 7\nconduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000487.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document32_ Filed o7/l8/l9 Page l6 of 33 |\n|\nvictim that] she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating with |\nlaw enforcement.” Id.

Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added).

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

The leter further\nexplains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public\neye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense\nmedia frenzy and threats follouing the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened\nthe safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, Ee For\nthese same reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse did not come forward as a co-signer at the\ntime of the initial hearing. (Ex. A).\n\n¢ Leters from numerous other friends and family members. These leters from\nMs. Maxwell’s other sureties and several family members and friends atest to Ms.\nMaxwell’s strong, forthright character and their confidence that she will not flee. The\nsureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B-N, W-X).\n\n¢ Financial report. The financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins\nLimited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell’s financial condition from 2ol5-\n2o2o, and discloses (i) all of her oun assets, (ll) all assets held in trust, and (ll) all of\nthe assets held by her spouse over that same time period. The report reflects that the\ntotal value of assets in all three categories is approximately $22.5 million, which is\nthe amount of the proposed bond. (Ex.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\nreasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001112.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeute/ntl $7o 2Ail ed 42SBM 26acedge l6 2o5\nIl.

(See Exs. A-N, W-X).

As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents | or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates.

Ms. Maxwell is Devoted to Her Spouse | and Would\nNever Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Country\n\nThe leter submited by Ms. Maxwell’s spouse pouerfully demonstrates that Ms.\nMaxwell has deep roots in the United States and is not a flight risk. The leter describes Ms.\nMaxwell’s domestic life with her spouse ie in the\nfour years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a “wonderful and loving\nperson,” who ls does not remotely resemble\nthe person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A § 4). Contrary to the government’s assertion\nthat Ms. Maxwell lived a rootless, “transient” lifestyle (Dkt. 4 at 9), Ms. Maxwell lived a\nquiet family life with her spouse | until\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart.\n\nThe person described in the criminal charges is not the person we knou.

See Ex. i\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001125.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FOd3GouAuNt DibeuMe/tl $7o 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a edged 29 2o45\n\nThe government argued to the Court that defense counsel’s contact with the\nprosecutors in the months leading up to Ms. Maxwell’s arrest prove litle about her intent to\nstay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). Es statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001128.jpg": "Cased 2o-€F Qd3GouAUNt Dibeutre/otl £7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge 32 2o5\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (/d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U:S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL l456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999)\n(vacating district court’s detention order and reinstating magistrate’s release order, which\nrequired foreign citizen and resident to sign an “irrevocable waiver of extradition” as a condition\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001149.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNE n De GmMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Rage 7l Ob 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001165.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck 3 Ob 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001169.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deageck 7l Ob 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001193.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/ooBBGHAUNt DOcuNei LA8 2 Filed6R223/2thgPageBlGdl5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden\nA. The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell’s Substantial\nTies to the United States, Including Her Spouse i\n\nThe government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new\ninformation and that the Court was “already aware of” the defendant’s friends and family in\nthe United States. (Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\n|| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001259.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd3souAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3i2e8/2agPidge& 66l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request. Ud. § ll).\nThe provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the\nperson whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship. To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l).

Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n* See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid\ndetection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov.\nMem. at 8).

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents [or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates.

The leter describes Ms.\nMaxwell’s domestic life with her spouse Sie in the\nfour years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a “wonderful and loving\nperson,” wh i does not remotely resemble\nthe person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A § 4). Contrary to the government’s assertion\nthat Ms. Maxwell lived a rootless, “transient” lifestyle (Dkt. 4 at 9), Ms. Maxwell lived a\nquiet family life with her spouse Pe until\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart.\n\nThe person described in the criminal charges is not the person we knou.

(Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from\nP| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). FY statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ool\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002004.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 32 of 45\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U.S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

The human rights objections that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face\nextradition to the US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n\n35. Finally, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that her extradition would\nbe incompatible with her rights under the ECHR**. The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The decision in Love was based on section 9l of the 2oo3\nAct, and the court made no finding under Article 3 (para l23). In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary threshold” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page lo of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nappealed before the Investigating Chamber of the Court of appeal, by the Prosecutor\nGeneral or the requested person.\n\nD.

The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 23 of 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 27 of 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page 8 of l5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nII. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden\nA. The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell’s Substantial\nTies to the United States, Including Her Spouse ee\n\nThe government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new\ninformation and that the Court was “already aware of” the defendant’s friends and family in\nthe United States. (Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\nP| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearmg, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

Yet, it is in precisely this\nseting—involving a defendant who, despite her years of denials, has been publicly atacked,\nthreatened, and vilified like few others in recent memory—that the government’s scrupulous\nadherence to the law in prosecuting a criminal defendant is most critical. As the motions being\nfiled today <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>, the government has repeatedly fallen short of its obligations here. The\nindictment must be dismissed.\n\nThe government’s sudden zeal to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for alleged conduct with\nEpstein in the l99os—conduct for which the government never even charged Epstein—follous a\nhistory that is both highly unusual and deeply troubling. The government (and state authorities)\ninvestigated Epstein thoroughly in 2oo6 for alleged conduct that is essentially identical to the\nconduct alleged in the current indictment. In 2oo7, the government’s investigation was resolved\nwhen it entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Epstein, which was negotiated\nunder the supervision of R. Alexander Acosta, then United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”), and approved by senior levels of Main Justice, including the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General. In that NPA, the government agreed that any federal\nprosecution of Epstein in the SDFL would be deferred in exchange for Epstein’s agreement to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 38\ndefendant); it is about whether the government, in bringing charges, has met the governing legal\nstandards. It has not done so here, and the indictment must be dismissed.\n\na\n\nThis memorandum focuses on the NPA. As this memorandum demonstrates, Ms.\nMaxwell’s indictment violates the clear and unqualified terms of the NPA and should therefore\nbe dismissed. The NPA was heavily negotiated over approximately eight months and involved\nnot only Epstein and the SDFL but also senior levels of Main Justice in Washington, D.C., which\napproved the NPA before its execution. Given the blistering public criticism of the NPA and of\nAcosta’s handling of the Epstein investigation, it is understandable that the current regime may\nwish the government had not entered into the NPA, or that it had negotiated different terms.\nIndeed, the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”) found that\nAcosta exercised “poor judgment” and “agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the\nNPA,” which OPR characterized as a “unique resolution.”\n\nBut the government is bound by the agreement it negotiated and executed. And the NPA\nis clear, explicit, and unambiguous. The government cannot nou ask this Court to rewrite the\nagreement in a way more favorable to its current position, nor overlook key distinctions in the\nagreement, by claiming that they were drafting mistakes or omissions. Nor may the government\nask this Court to construe ambiguities in its favor, in contravention of black-leter law that non-\nprosecution agreements must be construed strictly against the government.\n\nThe government, in prior submissions, has raised three arguments why the NPA does not\napply here, none of which has merit:\n\nFirst, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA\nbecause she is not a party to it and is not named in it. The government ignores that the parties to\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 38\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the\nunderlying negotiations <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\nprosecutions for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the\nindictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of\nthe parties to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an\nevidentiary hearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nOn or about September 24, 2oo7, Epstein and his counsel entered into the NPA with\nAcosta, the United States Atorney for the SDFL.* While USAOs in a number of judicial\ndistricts, including this District, typically use a standard template for plea agreements and other\nnon-prosecution agreements, this NPA did not follou such a standard format. To the contrary,\n\n* A copy of the NPA is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 38\nNPA’s references to the “United States” <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a definitional intent not to limit such\nprovisions to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe NPA begins with several factual recitals. After noting certain details of the\ninvestigation and indictment by the Florida State Atorney’s Office, the recitals state, among\nother things, that (l) the “United States Atorney’s Office” and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) have “conducted their oun investigation into Epstein’s background and\nany offenses that may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from in or\naround 2ool through in or around September 2oo7, including” five enumerated federal criminal\noffenses; (ll) Epstein seeks “to resolve globally his state and federal criminal liability” and thus\nis agreeing to comply with the terms of the NPA “in exchange for the benefits provided by this\nagreement”; and (i) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the Defendant\nwill be served by the follouing procedure.” NPA at l-2 (emphasis added). Nouhere in the\nrecitals is reference made specifically to the SDFL or to the USAO-SDFL, nor is there any\nsuggestion that the parties in any way intended to limit the “global[]” resolution of Epstein’s\nliability.\n\nThe NPA then provides that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these offenses\nshall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by”\nthe terms of the NPA. NPA at 2. The NPA also provides that, after its terms are fulfilled,\n\nno prosecution for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement [e.g.,\n\nthe five enumerated federal offenses], nor any other offenses that have been the\n\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the\n\nUnited States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal\n\nGrand Jury investigation’ will be instituted in this District, and the charges\n\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed.\n\n3 Like the various references to the United States and its agents, the term “Federal Grand Jury investigation” is not\ndefined in the NPA.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 38\ndiscovery demonstrates that\nee ae\n[|\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to obtain a global\nresolution that would, among other things, provide maximum protection for any alleged co-\nconspirators, in significant part to minimize the likelihood that Epstein could be subpoenaed as a\npotential witness and have to testify under oath. NPA at 2 (noting that Epstein “seeks to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability”). The NPA makes clear that its identification of\nfour “potential co-conspirators” by name—Kellen, Ross, Groff, and Marcinkova—was not\nintended to limit the immunity provision to those four individuals (“but not limited to”), and we\nunderstand that those individuals ee\nPE oo)\nLT\neC‘ S\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Supreme Court has long recognized the enforceability of plea agreements. “[W]hen\na plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can\nbe said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.”\nSantobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l).\n\nWhile plea agreements are interpreted under basic principles of contract law, the Second\nCircuit has noted that “plea agreements . . . are unique contracts in which special due process\nconcerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards obtain.” United States v. Ready,\n82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996) (internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v.\nMozer, 828 F. Supp. 2o8, 2l5 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“[A] prosecutor entering into a plea bargain\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 25\nId. Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under\nthe age of l8 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an\nelement of the offense.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded as much in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th\nCir. 2oll). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of possession of child\npornography. /d. at 8l7-l8. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts\nof the case did involve the sexual abuse of a child, including the production and possession of\nchild pornography. /d. at 8l3-l4. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of\npossession of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general\nstatute of limitations, but the offense of production of child pornography did involve sexual\nabuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the\ntime of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing child\npornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., the sexual abuse of a child.” Jd. at\n8l7.\n\nCoutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other\nstatutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a\nparticular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse\nor kidnapping of a child. /d. at 8l7. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of\n§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the\ngovernment would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the\noffense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its\ncharges are not time-barred.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002677.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of l6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

But the allegations as to Accuser-3 cannot possibly support the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell: Although the gravamen of a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense is enticing or causing an\nindividual to travel, there is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled—let alone that Ms.\nMaxwell (or Epstein, for that mater) enticed her to do so or transported her. Moreover, although\nboth § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) require an intent that the traveling individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity, the indictment alleges no facts suggesting that Epstein’s alleged sexual activity\nwith Accuser-3, who was over the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times, was\nunlawful.

Evid. 4o4(b) “governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or subsequent ‘bad\nacts’—evidence of ‘crimes, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United\nStates v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).\n\nAs shoun above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is irrelevant to the conspiracy counts.\nThus, to the extent that the government intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such\nevidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed. R. Evid.\nAo4(b).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2689\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 23\n\nFor these reasons, we respectfully request that the Court order the government to\nimmediately disclose all favorable evidence (Brady and Giglio material) within its\npossession and to immediately disclose all such material upon future discovery or receipt, to\nprovide the defense will have ample opportunity to make use of it at trial.\nIV. Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 4 of 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply.

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 Filed o3/26/2l Page2of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena.

Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F.

Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\nl A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF.

Supp. at 553\n(“[D]ocuments are not evidentiary for Rule l7(c) purposes if their use is limited to impeachment.”).\nTHE SUBPOENA FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nThe Defendant cannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the Subpoena meets Rule l7(c)’s requirements for\nfour, independent reasons. First, the Subpoena is overbroad and non-specific, and a clear fishing\nexpedition to “see what may turn up.” See United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG),\n2o2o WL 86768, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o) (denying motion for issuance of Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena). “Subpoenas seeking ‘any and all’ materials, without mention of ‘specific admissible\nevidence,’ justify the inference that the defense is engaging in the type of ‘fishing expedition’\nprohibited by Mixon.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2-5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited) (granting motion to quash Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena).\n\nHere, the Subpoena plainly fails Nixon’s specificity requirement. Requests | through 5 all\nseek “communications” between “You” and a designated individual or entity, including the U.S.\nAtorney and BSF’s co-counsel, about a certain subject. The Subpoena defines “communications”\nas “all forms of correspondence, including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or\nother writen communication of information of any kind,” and defines “You” as “any ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of Boies, Schiller, Flexner, LLP, including but not limited to\nDavid Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Peter Skinner and any former ouner, shareholder, partner or\nemployee, or independent contractor of the firm.” Such broad Requests are plainly overbroad and\nnon-specific, and do not meet the strict requirements of Rule l7(c). See, e.g., Mendinueta-Ibarro,\n956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l2-5l3 (quashing subpoena that requested “‘any and all writings and records’\nrelated to the [police department’s] contact with a particular confidential witness”); Pena, 2ol6\nWL 8735699, at *3 (Nathan, J.)

Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 4 of 7\nbecause “the subpoena was not crafted to call for admissible evidence. Rather, it called for the\nproduction of the entire investigative file and is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).\n\nSimilarly, Request l2 asks for “EVCP Material,” which is defined as “any submission to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims on behalf of\npersons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases\nsigned by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your Clients.” This\nRequest does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is not a party or otherwise privy to\nwhat information BSF has submited to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nor on behalf of which clients BSF has submited such information. The Defendant cannot merely\nrequest every piece of confidential information that BSF submited to the Program in the hopes\nthat something relevant and admissible turns up. This Request thus cannot pass muster under Rule\nl7(c).\n\nSecond, although BSF does not knou what arguments the Defendant made in her ex parte\nmotion, the documents and items requested in the Subpoena bear no apparent relevance to the\nDefendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this mater. And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c). Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo, 7ol.\n\nRequest l seeks communications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney about the Defendant\nfrom 2ol5 through the present, and Requests 3 through 5 seek communications between BSF and\nBSF’s co-counsel from 2ol5 through the present regarding any meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\nnarrative that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears JM).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2oll). Given\nthe marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will be unable to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and its co-counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 Filed o3/26/2l Page5of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 5 of 7\nthan impeachment, many of them are procurable from the Government and are thus improper\nsubjects of a Rule l7(c) subpoena, as explained belou.\n\nRequests 2 through 5 also seek communications from 2ol5 through the present between\nBSF, its co-counsel, and the U.S. Atorney about Jean Luc Brunel, who is presently incarcerated\nin France on charges of sex crimes and is one of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nco-conspirators. But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS¥’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o, 2o2o),\nECF No. lo8 (“[P]laintiff produced certain pages from a diary dated in early l996 which detailed,\nonly, that Jeffrey Epstein had held her hand in a movie theater in late l995 which made her feel\nuncomfortable. This same diary contained exactly zero references to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary\nto the assertions in her Complaint . . . .” (emphasis in original)).\n\nRequest l2 for “EVCP Material” is not relevant to the Defendant’s defense. BSF submited\nclaims and supporting evidence to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of\nseveral Epstein survivors who have not made separate claims against Maxwell. The Defendant\nmust <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the relevance of all the evidence she seeks by means of a Rule l7(c) subpoena,\nnot merely that she could turn up something that is relevant and admissible.

The Defendant simply\ncannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a// of the information submited on behalf of a// of BSF’s clients would\nbe relevant and admissible in this mater.*\n\nFurther, the Defendant has made it clear that she seeks to use the “EVCP Material” for\nimpeachment purposes. She has requested not only BSF’s submissions to the Program, but also\nany releases signed by BSF’s clients and any compensation received by BSF’s clients. The\nDefendant already atempted to obtain information about Annie Farmer’s compensation by the\nProgram in Ms. Farmer’s recently dismissed civil action against the Defendant. In the Defendant’s\nsubmissions in that mater, she explicitly stated that she sought the information in order to impeach\nMs. Farmer if she were to testify at her criminal trial:\n\nBy contrast, there is substantial evidence that [Ms. Farmer] and [BSF] filed this\n\ncase with a serious ulterior motive to fabricate a story against Ms. Maxwell some\n\n24 years after the fact. The motives include, but are not limited to, increasing the\n\ncash consideration that she might receive from the Epstein Victims Compensation\n\nProgram (“EVCP”). . . . Just as [Ms. Farmer] has a public right to make her false\n\nallegations in a lawsuit and in the news, so Ms. Maxwell should have the right to\n\nmake public the simple fact that plaintiff did not have a desire for “justice,” she had\n\na desire for money. . .\n\nSecond, as previously explained, Ms. Farmer has publicly self-identified as one of\n\nthe accusers mentioned in the indictment in the criminal case, 2o-cr-33o (AJN). She\n\nwill no doubt be one of the prosecution’s key witnesses. The inability to obtain an\n\nunredacted copy of the release, including the consideration received by Ms. Farmer,\n\ncreates legal prejudice to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to confront Ms. Farmer during her\n\ncriminal trial on general issues of bias and motive for fabrication, as is her right\n\nunder the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\nLeter from L. Menninger to Hon. Lorna G. Schofield at 2—3, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke,\net al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2o2l), ECF No. ll4; see also Leter from L.\nMenninger to Hon. Debra C.

Jd, The Jury :\nPlan provides that “the number of names drawn from each county should be proportionate to the |\nnumber of registered voters in that county.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *l. |\nThe two master wheels draw from a different array of counties. The Manhatan master |\nwheel randomly draws names from New York, Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland, :\nwhile the White Plains master wheel draws names from Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan and Dutchess. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *l. Because Westchester, Putnam, and :\nRockland counties are included in both master wheels, the Jury Plan instructs that the names\nfrom these counties be “apportioned among the two master wheels to ‘reasonably reflect the\nrelative number of registered voters of each county.’” See id.\n“Periodically, names are drawn from the master wheels ‘in an amount sufficient to meet |\nthe anticipated demands for jurors for the next six months.” Jd. (quoting Jury Pian). Those who\nare drawn from the master wheels are sent jury questionnaires,’ which determine whether a\nperson is qualified to serve on a jury. Id. Jurors who meet the qualification requirements are\nthen placed in the respective qualified wheels for Manhatan and White Plains. /d. Finally, as\nThe Jury Plan bases its qualification criteria on neutral standards such as the ability to speak\nEnglish, citizenship and age, mental capacity, and criminal record. (See Gov’t Opp. Br. at 5.)\nMoreover, certain individuals are exempted from jury service by virtue of their professional\noccupations. (See id.)

But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above.

Supp. at 553\n(“[D]ocuments are not evidentiary for Rule l7(c) purposes if their use is limited to impeachment.”).\nTHE SUBPOENA FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nThe Defendant cannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the Subpoena meets Rule l7(c)’s requirements for\nfour, independent reasons. First, the Subpoena is overbroad and non-specific, and a clear fishing\nexpedition to “see what may turn up.” See United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG),\n2o2o WL 86768, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o) (denying motion for issuance of Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena). “Subpoenas seeking ‘any and all’ materials, without mention of ‘specific admissible\nevidence,’ justify the inference that the defense is engaging in the type of ‘fishing expedition’\nprohibited by Nixon.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2-5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited) (granting motion to quash Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena).\n\nHere, the Subpoena plainly fails Nixon’s specificity requirement. Requests l through 5 all\nseek “communications” between “You” and a designated individual or entity, including the U.S.\nAtorney and BSF’s co-counsel, about a certain subject. The Subpoena defines “communications”\nas “all forms of correspondence, including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or\nother writen communication of information of any kind,” and defines “You” as “any ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of Boies, Schiller, Flexner, LLP, including but not limited to\nDavid Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Peter Skinner and any former ouner, shareholder, partner or\nemployee, or independent contractor of the firm.” Such broad Requests are plainly overbroad and\nnon-specific, and do not meet the strict requirements of Rule l7(c). See, e.g., Mendinueta-Ibarro,\n956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l2-5l3 (quashing subpoena that requested “‘any and all writings and records’\nrelated to the [police department’s] contact with a particular confidential witness”); Pena, 2ol6\nWL 8735699, at *3 (Nathan, J.)

Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 4 of 7\nbecause “the subpoena was not crafted to call for admissible evidence. Rather, it called for the\nproduction of the entire investigative file and is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).\n\nSimilarly, Request l2 asks for “EVCP Material,” which is defined as “any submission to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including amy claims on behalf of\npersons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases\nsigned by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your Clients.” This\nRequest does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is not a party or otherwise privy to\nwhat information BSF has submited to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nor on behalf of which clients BSF has submited such information. The Defendant cannot merely\nrequest every piece of confidential information that BSF submited to the Program in the hopes\nthat something relevant and admissible turns up. This Request thus cannot pass muster under Rule\nl7(c).\n\nSecond, although BSF does not knou what arguments the Defendant made in her ex parte\nmotion, the documents and items requested in the Subpoena bear no apparent relevance to the\nDefendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this mater. And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c). Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo, 7ol.\n\nRequest l seeks communications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney about the Defendant\nfrom 2ol5 through the present, and Requests 3 through 5 seek communications between BSF and\nBSF’s co-counsel from 2ol5 through the present regarding any meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\nnarrative that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena issued to BSF for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears to be BSF).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2oll). Given\nthe marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will be unable to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and its co-counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo288o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl9l Filed o3/3o/2l Page5of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS/’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o, 2o2o),\nECF No. lo8 (“[P]laintiff produced certain pages from a diary dated in early l996 which detailed,\nonly, that Jeffrey Epstein had held her hand in a movie theater in late l995 which made her feel\nuncomfortable. This same diary contained exactly zero references to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary\nto the assertions in her Complaint . . . .” (emphasis in original)).\n\nRequest l2 for “EVCP Material” is not relevant to the Defendant’s defense. BSF submited\nclaims and supporting evidence to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of\nseveral Epstein survivors who have not made separate claims against Maxwell. The Defendant\nmust <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the relevance of all the evidence she seeks by means of a Rule l7(c) subpoena,\nnot merely that she could turn up something that is relevant and admissible.

The Defendant simply\ncannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a// of the information submited on behalf of all of BSF’s clients would\nbe relevant and admissible in this mater.*\n\nFurther, the Defendant has made it clear that she seeks to use the “EVCP Material” for\nimpeachment purposes. She has requested not only BSF’s submissions to the Program, but also\nany releases signed by BSF’s clients and any compensation received by BSF’s clients. The\nDefendant already atempted to obtain information about Annie Farmer’s compensation by the\nProgram in Ms. Farmer’s recently dismissed civil action against the Defendant. In the Defendant’s\nsubmissions in that mater, she explicitly stated that she sought the information in order to impeach\nMs. Farmer if she were to testify at her criminal trial:\n\nBy contrast, there is substantial evidence that [Ms. Farmer] and [BSF] filed this\n\ncase with a serious ulterior motive to fabricate a story against Ms. Maxwell some\n\n24 years after the fact. The motives include, but are not limited to, increasing the\n\ncash consideration that she might receive from the Epstein Victims Compensation\n\nProgram (“EVCP”). . . . Just as [Ms. Farmer] has a public right to make her false\n\nallegations in a lawsuit and in the news, so Ms. Maxwell should have the right to\n\nmake public the simple fact that plaintiff did not have a desire for “justice,” she had\n\na desire for money. ..\n\nSecond, as previously explained, Ms. Farmer has publicly self-identified as one of\n\nthe accusers mentioned in the indictment in the criminal case, 2o-cr-33o (AJN). She\n\nwill no doubt be one of the prosecution’s key witnesses. The inability to obtain an\n\nunredacted copy of the release, including the consideration received by Ms. Farmer,\n\ncreates legal prejudice to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to confront Ms. Farmer during her\n\ncriminal trial on general issues of bias and motive for fabrication, as is her right\n\nunder the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\nLeter from L.

This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, which presumes\na narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively\nestablish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”’) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 239\n“a direct and primary object of the contracting parties was to confer a benefit on the third party.”\nFla. W. Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (quoting Bochese v. Toun of Ponce Inlet, 4o5\nF.3d 964, 982 (llth Cir. 2oo5)). In other words, “the intent of the parties is the key” to evaluating\nwhether an individual is a third party beneficiary. /d.\n\nHere, the defendant has offered no evidence that the parties intended to confer a benefit on\nher in particular, or that her crimes in the l99os make her a member of the class of “co-\nconspirators” the parties had in mind when they negotiated the NPA. To the contrary, the OPR’s\ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of this provision in the NPA strongly\nundercuts any such argument, and OPR’s findings <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the parties did not intend to\nconfer a benefit on the defendant. With respect to the “co-conspirator” provision, the OPR Report\nconcluded, in relevant part:\n\nOther than various drafts of the NPA and of a federal plea\nagreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous records\nmentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects\ndiscussed or debated it—or even gave it much consideration. Drafts\nof the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou that the final\nbroad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein” evolved from a more narrou provision\nsought by the defense. The provision expanded as [USAO-SDFL\nprosecutor Maria] Villafafia and defense counsel exchanged drafts\nof, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the NPA,\nwith apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within\nthe USAO about the Provision.\nOPR Report at l66. With respect to Maxwell in particular, OPR interviewed Maria Villafafia, the\nlead prosecutor on the case, and noted:\nVillafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s\nlongtime relationship with a close female friend who was a well-\nknoun socialite, but, according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t\nhave any specific evidence against her.” Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would\nbenefit from the provision were the four female assistants identified\nby name.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 239\n\ncan use to carry her heavy burden. Without proof of actual prejudice, the motion fails. Second,\neven if the Court finds actual prejudice to the defense, the defendant has not established that the\nGovernment’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment delay was improper or designed to gain any\nsort of tactical advantage. The Government obtained an indictment charging the defendant on\nJune 29, 2o2o, less than two years after opening its investigation and less than a year after victims\nwith information critical to the pending charges came forward. The defendant thus cannot\nestablish an undue delay, much less a delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nBecause the defendant cannot establish either element, let alone both, her due process claim\nis meritless and should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant Has Failed to <span class=\"highlight\">Demonstrate</span> Actual and Substantial Prejudice\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is well-setled that the statute of limitations is “the primary guarantee against bringing\noverly stale criminal charges.” United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 322 (l97l) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited). Thus, when a case has been brought within the statute of\nlimitations, it is “only rarely dismissed,” and carries a “strong presumption of validity.” United\nStates v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d\n688, 694 (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Second Circuit standard for pre-indictment delay is clear, and it imposes a heavy\nburden on the defendant to shou that: (i) “he suffered actual prejudice because of the alleged pre-\nindictment delay,” and (i) “that such delay was a course intentionally pursued by the government\nfor an improper purpose.” Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (citations omited). The burden for proving\nboth prongs of the standard rests squarely on the defendant. United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.3d\n993, lol4 (2d Cir. l99o); United States v. Rubin, 6o9 F.2d 5l, 66 (2d Cir. l979); United States v.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003005.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 239\nwould have found the witness credible” (citations omited)). “Courts have held that ‘the defendant\nalso has the burden of shouing that the lost testimony or information was not available through\nother means.’” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d\nlo37, lo4l (8th Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nThe vast majority of pre-indictment delay cases fail on the first prong. See, e.g., Marion,\n4o4 U.S. at 324-25 (fading witness memories insufficient; “no one suggests that every delay-\ncaused detriment to a defendant’s case should abort a criminal prosecution”); United States v.\nSnyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v. Iannelli, 46l F.2d 483, 485 (2d Cir. l972) (unavailability\nof witnesses insufficient prejudice); United States v. King, 56o F.2d l22, l3o-3l (2d Cir. l977)\n(death of witness and missing documents insufficient prejudice); Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o,\nat *4-5 (death of a defense witness and defendant’s oun memory issues insufficient prejudice).\n\nZe Discussion\n\nThe defendant points to at least four ways in which she claims the passage of time\nprejudiced her defense, but none of her hypothetical claims of prejudice withstand scrutiny. In\nparticular, she contends that, as a result of the passage of time, four witnesses have died, unnamed\nEpstein employees have been “lost,” unspecified witnesses nou have “failed or corrupted”\nmemories, and records have been lost or destroyed. She further contends that these collectively\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> actual prejudice. (Def. Mot. 7 at 8-l4). None has merit, individually or collectively.\n\nWith respect to the first three arguments, the fact that certain witnesses cannot testify\nbecause of their deaths or failed memories does not compel a finding of actual prejudice. “Faded\nmemories or unavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal\na defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.”\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 239\nUnited States v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988). The defendant has not made such\na shouing. Her speculative assertions simply do not rise to that level.\n\nThe defendant first claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-\nindictment delay due to the unavailability of Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the\nalleged agent of Minor Victim-l), and Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarey.\nShe contends that the loss of Epstein demonstrates actual prejudice because Epstein “would have”\ntestified that the defendant did not engage in the criminal activity with which she is charged. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 8). That assertion is speculative at best, and the law is clear that “proof of prejudice must\nbe definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6; see also Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657\n(finding that “perceived prejudice is speculative” where there was “no way of knouing what [the\nunavailable witness’s] testimony would have been”). To credit Maxwell’s argument is to assume\nthat Epstein, after being indicted with federal sex trafficking charges, would have taken the stand,\nwould not have invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, and would have provided testimony that\nexculpated Maxwell, which a jury would have credited in the face of contradictory trial evidence.\nThis is an exercise in chain upon chain of conjecture that comes nouhere close to meeting the\nburden of demonstrating actual prejudice. See Spears, l59 F.3d at lo85 (“[A] defendant must do\nmore than shou that a particular witness is unavailable and that the witness’ testimony would have\nhelped the defense. He must also shou that the witness would have testified, withstood cross-\nexamination, and that the jury would have found the witness credible.” (citations omited)); see\nalso United States v. Valona, 834 F.2d l334, l339 (7th Cir. l987) (noting that prejudice analysis\nmust consider whether the missing witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” whether\nthe jury would have found him a “credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when compared\nto other trial evidence “would affect the trial outcome” (internal quotation marks and citations\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 239\ndeath.'’ As such, it is neither surprising nor terribly probative of any issue in dispute in this case\nthat Detective Recarey might have testified to a lack of knouledge as to what the victims identified\nin this Indictment have told the USAO-SDNY. In sum, the defendant has not put “specific\nevidence” before this Court demonstrating that the loss of Detective Recarey’s testimony, even if\nadmissible, has caused her actual prejudice. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d at 4oo.\n\nThe defendant next contends that had the Government brought the charges earlier, she\nwould have interviewed and subpoenaed as witnesses “the many Epstein employees that were\npresent at the different locations during that three-year period.” (Def. Mot. 7 at ll). She does not\nspecify which employees she would have called as witnesses, the grounds for contending they are\n“lost” or “missing,” whether they would have been willing to testify, or what admissible evidence\nthey would have provided. She merely speculates that the evidence could have helped her defense.\nThis is far from the definite proof of prejudice required to state a due process claim. See United\nStates v. Greer, 956 F. Supp. 525, 528 (D. Vt. l997) (“In the context of unavailable witnesses, the\ndefendant must offer some grounds for his belief that the absent witness would have helped his\ncase in a material way.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)).\n\nThe defendant also argues that “[m]any potential witnesses have been contacted in relation\nto this mater and other related litigations,” noting that “[s]ignificant numbers of potential\nwitnesses no longer remember when events may have occurred” or “who was present.” (Def. Mot.\n7 at l2). Dimming or fading memories over the passage of time are not in themselves sufficient\nto “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that [defendants] cannot receive a fair trial” or “justify the dismissal of the\nindictment.” Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 326; Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d at lo59. Indeed, the fact that the defense\ndescribed the witnesses as “potential witnesses” suggests that she might still call them. Further,\n’ The third victim, Minor Victim-2, was interviewed previously by the FBI. The Government is\nnot aware of Detective Recarey having participated in an interview of Minor Victim-2.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3olo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 239\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish That the Government Delayed the\nIndictment for An Improper Purpose\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay.*® See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong.”). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.’” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\nl6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides ample information about the\ncharged crimes and the victims referenced in the Indictment. Additionally, many of the\ndefendant’s requests fall within the scope of the Government’s Giglio and Jencks Act obligations,\nwhich the Government intends to produce at the appropriate stage in the litigation, well in advance\nof trial.\n°° The defendant invites the Court to engage in a balancing test that weighs the prejudice to the\ndefendant against the Government’s reasons for delay. (Def. Mot. 7 at 5,6 n.4). This Court should\nreject the defendant’s invitation. The defendant cites United States v. Brand, 556 F.2d l3l2, l3l7\nn.7 (Sth Cir. l977), for the proposition that a shouing of prejudice triggers such balancing. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 5). Houever, the Fifth Circuit subsequently rejected such a balancing test, finding that\nthe “Brand footnote is pure dicta” and instead requiring that defendants <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the\nprosecution intentionally caused the delay to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant or “for\nsome other bad faith purpose.” United States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d l497, l5o9, l5l2 (Sth Cir. l996).\nThe defendant also cites that several Circuit courts, namely the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth\nCircuits, require such a balancing test. (Def. Mot. 7 at 6n.4). The Second Circuit, houever, “has\nnot adopted any balancing test, as the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have, and its\nJurisprudence suggests that it would not do so.” United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n49o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). Several other Circuits have also “refused to adopt a balancing test.” Jd.\n(collecting cases). This Court should follou that example.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 239\n\nThe Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment\nfiled within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,\ndeliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical\nadvantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (delay must be “intentional\ndevice to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused”); see also United States v. Alameh, 34l\nF.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (“To shou unjustifiable conduct, a defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that\nthe government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical advantage.”); see also United\nStates v. Delacruz, 97o F. Supp. 2d l99, 2o3 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“Delacruz’s motion to dismiss\nwould nevertheless fail for the independent reason that he has not made any shouing that the\npreindictment delay was an intentional device designed by the Government to gain a tactical\nadvantage.”’); United States v.

Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 67l (2d Cir. l987))). Indeed, some version of the phrase\n“deliberate device” and “tactical advantage” is found in nearly every Second Circuit decision on\nthe issue. See, e.g., Alameh, 34l F.3d at l76 (“intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical\nadvantage”); Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (requiring “intentional device” to gain “tactical\nadvantage”); Lawson, 683 F.2d at 694 (delay not “engineered by the government for an improper\npurpose, such as gaining a tactical advantage’’); Snyder, 668 F.2d at 689; United States v.

The\ndefendant ignores the fact that cases such as this one take time to investigate and indict.\n\nThe defendant also suggests that the Government engaged in reckless disregard of\ncircumstances that would likely impede her ability to mount an effective defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at\n5-6, l5). As an initial mater, this argument falls short of “a standard that requires a shouing of\nintentionality.” United States v.

I).\nSubsequently, on April l6, 2ol9, Judge Netburn denied the Government’s application. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H). Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the\nprotective order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional\ncircumstances or a compelling need. (/d. at 3). She concluded that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the protective order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and\n“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn concluded that “the\nGovernment must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that\nthe reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to\nmodify the Protective Order. The Government has not met that standard.” (/d. at 7) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n8. Unsealing of Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nThree months after Chief Judge McMahon issued her Order, Giuffre v. Maxwell was\nreassigned to the Honorable Loreta A. Preska on July 9, 2ol9. On or about July 23, 2o2o, Judge\nPreska ordered unsealed certain litigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell’s April\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003053.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 239\n\nSecond, the Government did not misrepresent the extent of its knouledge of the contents\nof Boies Schiller’s files. As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government\nhad “either litle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there\nare [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l7). In support of her argument, Maxwell\ncites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David\nBoies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2ol6, asking ‘if the\nSouthern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the\nGovernment has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-l does not\nrecall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-l\ndoes not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury\n(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2ol6 meeting refer to the existence of depositions\ngenerally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general\nunderstanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at\n2l). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knouledge of the\ncontents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon were incorrect.\n\nIn sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief\nJudge McMahon, and as such, the good faith exception applies. To the contrary, the record before\nthe Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nquestion and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in\nconnection with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knouledge of the contents of that file,\nand the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the protective order.\nUpon receiving a court order issued by a Chief United States District Judge who had carefully\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 239\n3. The Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained Pursuant to\nthe Subpoena Under the Fifth Amendment Is Without Merit\n\nThe defendant’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to the subpoena on Fifth\nAmendment grounds fails for multiple, independent reasons. As an initial mater, Boies Schiller\nis not the Government and was not acting as an agent of the Government when it deposed the\ndefendant or otherwise litigated the civil case against her. That the defendant may regret her choice\nto respond to Boies Schiller’s questions during two depositions instead of invoking her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination does not transform that choice into a Fifth Amendment violation.\n\na. Applicable Law\ni. The Fifth Amendment — Generally\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part: “No person . . . shall be compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. To establish a Fifth\nAmendment violation, an individual must “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the existence of three elements:\nl) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication, and 3) the incriminating nature of that\ncommunication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d ll66, ll68 (l987); see also, e.g., In Re\nThree Grand Jury Subpoenas Jan. 5, l988, 847 F.2d lo24, lo28 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nIt is “axiomatic that the Amendment does not automatically preclude self-incrimination,\nwhether spontaneous or in response to questions put by government officials.” United States v.\nWashington, 43l U.S. l8l, l86 (l977). “Indeed, far from being prohibited by the Constitution,\nadmissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable.” Jd. at l87. “[T]he\nFifth Amendment proscribes only self-incrimination obtained by a ‘genuine compulsion of\ntestimony.’” /d.

The standard to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>\nmaterial false statements and omissions in an agent’s affidavit is a “high one.” Rivera v.

The intent prong of Franks is particularly demanding\nwith respect to omissions. “Franks protects against omissions that are designed to mislead, or that\nare made in reckless disregard of whether they would mislead.” Awadallah, 349 F.3d at 68\n(emphasis in original). After all, “‘[a]ll storytelling involves an element of selectivity,’ and it is\ntherefore not necessarily constitutionally significant that an affidavit ‘omit[s] facts which, in\nretrospect, seem significant.’” United States v.

Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. A question is “fundamentally ambiguous” when “it is not a phrase with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual\nunderstanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and\noffered as testimony.” /d. at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). In such a case, the “answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\nconviction.” United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Lighte, 782\nF.2d at 375). For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-conviction appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\nindication that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the exception, not the\nrule.” United States v. Sarwari, 669 F.3d 4ol, 4o7 (4th Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.\nFarmer, l37 F.3d l265, l269 (loth Cir. l998)). A defendant cannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> fundamental\nambiguity simply by shouing that words used in a question are amenable to multiple meanings,\nor that an answer “might generate a number of different interpretations.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375;\nUnited States v. Strohm, 67l F.3d ll73, ll78 (loth Cir. 2oll) (“Simply plumbing a question for\npost hoc ambiguity will not defeat a perjury conviction where the evidence demonstrates the\ndefendant understood the question in context and gave a knouingly false answer.”). “If, in the\n“” The Second Circuit analyzes general principles of perjury similarly under l8 U.S.C. § l623 and\nanother perjury statute, l8 U.S.C. § l62l, see Lighte, 782 F.3d at 372, and it has assumed without\ndeciding that those standards also apply to offenses under l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(2), see United States\nv.

Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used massage to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The similarity sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 239\nStates v.

Here, the defendant’s specific and unique\napproach to preparing minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the existence of\nsuch an idiosyncratic patern warranting admission.\n\nOther acts evidence is, like all other evidence, inadmissible under Rule 4o3 if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nEvidence is unfairly prejudicial, houever, “only when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a\ndefendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.”\nUnited States v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o). Other acts evidence is typically not\nunfairly prejudicial where it is not “any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes” with which\nthe defendant has been charged. United States v. Rolan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir. l99o).\nHere, as already discussed, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant\nand Epstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. Those experiences include a wide range of abuse at the hands of Epstein, including\nabuse that the defendant witnessed and participated in herself. Evidence regarding similar events\ninvolving Minor Victim-3, who was of a similar age and experienced similar types of sexual\ncontact, is no more “sensational or disturbing” than the other acts detailed in the Indictment. /d.\nEvidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly admited for\nsimilar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors. See, e.g., United States\nv. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“As to the testimony concerning Vickers’\n‘grooming’ of his victims, we conclude that such evidence was admissible even under Rule 4o4(b),\nbecause it was probative of Vickers’ knouledge of hou to secure adolescent boys’ trust so that he\ncould sexually abuse them.

Indeed, “‘[a] selection\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> systematic exclusion.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v. Superintendent\nRockview SCI, 939 F.3d 26o, 269 (2d Cir. 2ol9)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\nexclusion . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any identified group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 348\nOn that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than... everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue.

Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end.

THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\npersons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege is particularly applicable\nto grand jury proceedings.”) (citations omited).\n\nFinally, even were the Court to apply the Martindell test here,* despite the significant\ndistinguishing factors described above, this Investigation is a paradigmatic example of\nextraordinary circumstances.

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v.

Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges.

Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture.

Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *l (W.D.N.Y. May 8,\n2ol4), also does not help the government. This case concerned a one count indictment in 2ol3. It\nis patently clear from the opinion by the district court that the statements from the alleged victim\ndetailing the allegation had been provided to the defendant and the court which noted that the\nlengthy recitation of facts in the opinion “are taken from the allegations set forth in the Affidavit\nof Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Jennifer Jayne Amo submited in support of the\nMay l6, 2ol3 Criminal Complaint (Dkt.# l), the Indictment (Dkt.# 8), and the government's\nresponse to the instant motions (Dkt.# 2o).” 2ol4 WL l838255, at *3 n.l.

See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\nidentified as potential co-conspirators. In reviewing the negotiating history of the parties over\nthis provision, the OPR Report notes that the government had not specifically contemplated other\npotential co-conspirators, yet it also demonstrates that the Epstein defense lawyers consistently\n* The OPR Report, of which only the executive summary had been released previously, has been submited as\nExhibit 3 to the government’s opposition.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page9of23\nand successfully pushed back against the government’s atempts to limit the scope of the\nprovision. Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four\nindividuals, “any employee” of one of Epstein’s companies, and “any unnamed co-conspirators\nfor any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR Report at l66\nn.237. Defense counsel’s efforts were in line with their representations to the government that\nEpstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.”\nId. at l67 (internal quotations omited). When the government “finally revised” the language to\nthe provision that appears in the signed NPA, it obviously acceded to defense’s counsel’s desire\nto leave open the possibility that other “potential co-conspirators” might someday have occasion\nto invoke the immunity provision. /d. at l66.\n\nIn addition to being irrelevant, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell had largely\nescaped its atention at the time of the NPA is demonstrably incorrect. The government’s oun\nfile demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2oo6 (Opp. l6 n.9; Dkt. l48, Ex. B\n(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2’s claims regarding Ms. Maxwell nou\nincluded in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as\none of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2oo6 as part of the\ninvestigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.\nMaxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.\n\nAs a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status\nto enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9),\nfor the proposition that “plea agreements differ from commercial contracts” (Opp. l8), the\n“differ[ence]” to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement,\n* Accuser-2 is identified in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel3 of 23\nNew York Mellon Trust Co., 82l F.3d at 3o9; Collins, 929 F.3d at 84l; Penncro Assocs., 499\nF.3d at ll56-57. Here, the NPA contains only two immunity provisions: one for Epstein, which\nis expressly limited to the SDFL, and one for co-conspirators, which is not. The government’s\nclaim that this distinction reflects an intent to apply the limitation universally strains credulity.°\nIt is simply inconceivable that any reasonable prosecutor who intended to limit the co-\nconspirator immunity provision to the SDFL—and who had thought to include precisely such\nlimiting language in Epstein’s immunity provision—would have found it unnecessary to include\nidentical language in the co-conspirator immunity provision. Indeed, the omission reveals an\nintent not to so limit that provision.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening memorandum pointed out a second indication in the text of the\nNPA that the parties intended to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL:\nwhere a provision in the NPA is intended to refer only to the USAO-SDFL, it does so explicitly.\nSee Mem. at 8-9 (citing examples of NPA’s explicit references to USAO-SDFL). While the\ngovernment is correct that the use of the term “the United States” in a plea agreement, without\nmore, is insufficient under Annabi and its progeny to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> an intent to bind other\ndistricts, the NPA’s references to both the USAO-SDFL and “the United States” require an\ninference that a distinction between the two is intended—and that where “the United States” is\nused, the intent is to refer to the government as a whole.

But the cited passage in that brief argued only that the NPA did not bar the prosecution of Epstein in\nother districts, which is not in dispute; it made no such argument with respect to the prosecution of potential co-\nconspirators. In any event, any self-serving atempts by the USAO-SDFL to limit the NPA’s applicability years\nafter it was executed—after the NPA had been widely criticized and scrutinized—are no more probative of the\nparties’ intent in 2oo7 than the arguments made by the government here.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l6 of 23\nconsider extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent.’ To the extent that the Court finds that\nextrinsic evidence is relevant, houever, the government’s argument demonstrates precisely why\nthe Court should permit discovery in this action. While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without discovery. Any evidence of the parties’ intent would be in the possession of\nthe government and Epstein’s counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few\nclues available to the public—such as a privilege log filed in a related civil lawsuit—for crumbs\nof information about the negotiation and investigation.\n\nThe government’s response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic\nevidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—\nshould be preceded by discovery. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three\npages from the above-referenced privilege log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims,\nall of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL’s consultation with the United States\nAtorney’s Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL atorneys to New York, or interviews\nand/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses.

In response, the government has focused on only one of\nthose three entries and produced the documents referenced in the privilege log. See Opp. lo.\n\n7 The government’s argument that a United States Atorney lacks the “authority” to bind other districts (Opp. l3-\nl4)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Atorney has\nnot received the approvals prescribed by internal Justice Department guidelines—is unavailing. The government\ncites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not\nonly by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other\ndistricts—but also by the Second Circuit’s statement that a United States Atorney may bind other districts in a plea\nagreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect.

See also\nAvenati, 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings\nin question prior to trial in order “to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> witnesses’ bias or self-interest.”). The\narguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance\nthe materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is litle risk that\nreview of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial,\ngiven their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467, 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF\nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require\nproduction of the engagement leters to the Court so that the information can be made available\nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct testimony. See United\nStates v. Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), l992 WL 29644o, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, l992);\nUnited States v. Ferguson, No. 3:o6-CR-l37 (CFD), 2oo7 WL 45773o3, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec.\n26, 2oo7).\n\nMaxwell also argues that compulsion of the materials’ production under Rule l7(c) is\njustified because the materials appear not to have been produced by BSF in response to the grand\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page7of9\nSee United States v. Aguilar, No. CR o7-ooo3o (SBA), 2oo8 WL 3l82o29, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug.\n4, 2oo8). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary\nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are\nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be\nimpeachment evidence does not render them “relevant” for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those\ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538,\nat *2. Maxwell’s argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is\nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or\nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are\nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for\npurposes of cross-examination, leaving litle doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And\nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be\nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why\nthat expectation might be reasonable. The “mere hope” that the documents may contain some\nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena (or, as here,\nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), l984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the Government’s obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment\nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2-\n3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request l2’s compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell\nmay renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose\nsubmissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At\nthat time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require production of these materials to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page6eof9\nPage 6\n\nSecond, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena must be able to “reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be\ncontained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up.”\nBarnes, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omited); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o).\nThe defendant’s request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor\nVictim-2’s life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is irrelevant.\n\nTo justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the\ndiary in full: to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary’s\nauthenticity. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is necessary. That is insufficient, as explained above.\n\nThird, the request is barred by Rule l7(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule l7 to\n“subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness,” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h), explaining\nthat such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor\nVictim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that production is governed by Rule l6, Rule 26.2,\nBrady, and Giglio, but not Rule l7. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, l7 Cr. 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5 (“The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment\npurposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed\nagainst the Defendant.”)).

Here, the government has confessed enough facts to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that\nMaxwell at least is entitled to a hearing.\n\nThere is no merit to the government’s assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing\nbecause she has not submited an affidavit in support of her Motion. An affidavit is not a\nprerequisite to a hearing when the government has confessed the existence of facts sufficient to\nentitle a defendant to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nNor is an affidavit required when information at issue is peculiarly within the possession\nof the government (e.g., AUSA J and AUSA [) or others who are adverse to\nMaxwell (e.g., Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Potinger). See Cortina, 63o F.2d at l2l6 (“The\nviolation here is particularly insidious because it is difficult to uncover misrepresentations in an\n[ex parte submission].

R. Civ. P.\n3o(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct l7 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal\nsupport, Plaintiff atempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of\nseven hours with a right to take a total of 7o hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of\nthe Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and\nspeaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent\nlimitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.\n\nThe heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied\nPlaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth Amendment. This dashed Plaintiff's apparent\nhope to obtain an adverse inference, rather than actually having to prove her case against Ms.\nMaxwell. Instead, Ms. Maxwell fully testified for the entire 7 hours, responded to all questions\nposed to her,' and testified based on her actual knouledge. Ms. Maxwell’s testimony simply\nbears no relevance to Plaintiff's request to take more than lo depositions of non-party witnesses.\n\nConspicuously absent from Plaintiff's motion are (a) any actual information she believes\nthese witnesses may provide which is neither cumulative nor duplicative of other information\nalready disclosed in this case, (b) the fact the information can be obtained from other sources,\n\n' Plaintiff flatly mis-represents to the Court that Ms. Maxwell “refused” to answer the questions posed to\nher, as the actual transcript amply demonstrates. Ms. Maxwell did not avoid any questions and answered\nall questions to the best of her recollection relating to alleged events l5 years ago. The majority of the\nbullet point “summary” of the maters about which Ms. Maxwell could not testify were based either on a\nlack of any personal knouledge or the fact that the events claimed by Plaintiff did not actually happen.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page2ofl4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPage\nI.

The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagel2oofl4\nil. At Minimum, the Government Must <span class=\"highlight\">Demonstrate</span> the Admissibility of Evidence\n\nRegarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R.

R. Evid. 4o4(b).\nLitigation of the admissibility of this evidence is premature, and Ms. Maxwell reserves the right\nto challenge it at the appropriate juncture. Ms. Maxwell notes, houever, that the government’s\nargument that such evidence is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) suffers from the same\nflaws as its argument that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions regarding Accuser-3 constitute an overt\nact.\n\nThe government claims Accuser-3’s testimony is admissible to shou Ms. Maxwell’s\n“knouledge, intent, and modus operandi.” Opp. l58 (emphasis in original). The government’s\nvery use of those terms, houever, betrays an implication that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with\nAccuser-3 were somehou unlawful. Any knouledge or intent on Ms. Maxwell’s part that\nEpstein would engage in consensual sexual activity with Accuser-3, or any method by which she\npurportedly persuaded Accuser-3 to engage in such lawful conduct, has no bearing on whether\nMs. Maxwell knew or intended Accuser-l or Accuser-2 to engage in unlawful sexual activity.\nAnd Accuser-3’s proffered testimony about her “subjective experience” of her lawful,\nconsensual activity with Epstein certainly would not inform the jury as to Ms. Maxwell’s state of\nmind or conduct with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.

During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia recetved any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that none of the statutes identified by you can nghtly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged ln sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida ““with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7l of 349\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 246 of 349\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page6of2l\n\nA.

Maxwell contends that the Government violated her right against\ncompelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies of her deposition transcripts from her earlier\ncivil case.

Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe protective order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a subsequent criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\nprotective order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no guarantee that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v.

The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring).

The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8.

The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the relationship between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual assault involving different victims to be identical in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2. The court added that it would be “simply unreasonable” to require\ntwo incidents to be absolutely identical in order to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), and\nconcluded that “[i]t is the patern itself, and not the mere presence of some inconsistencies\nbetween the various assaults, that determines admissibility under these exceptions.” /d.\n\nAs to the temporal gap between the prior bad acts and the incident involving\nConstand, the Superior Court acknouledged that, even if the evidence were otherwise\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b), it “will be rendered inadmissible if it is too remote.” /d. at\n4o5 (quoting Commonwealth v.

D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A.

Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247.

The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury.

As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof relevance in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005514.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 59 of 69\nBecause nothing requires Ms. Maxwell to advise the government in advance of the\nevidence she intends to admit at trial or why that evidence is relevant, this Court should deny the\ngovernment’s motion. If Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence will be\n\nadmissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement. ABA Criminal Justice\nStandards, Defense Function, Standard 4-7.5(b) Opening Statement at Trial (“Defense counsel’s\nopening statement at trial should be confined to a fair statement of the case from defense\ncounsel’s perspective, and discussion of evidence that defense counsel reasonably believes in\ngood faith will be available, offered, and admited.”). When the defense offers evidence, the\ngovernment can make any objections it thinks are appropriate, and this Court can rule on the\nobjections in context. See United States v. Rounds, No. lo-CR-239S (l)(2)(3), 2ol5 WL\n59l8372, at *l (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2ol5) (“Without hearing the evidence in context, this Court\ncannot enter a blanket pretrial ruling. The government’s motion in /imine is therefore denied as\npremature, without prejudice to the government raising this issue at an appropriate time during\ntrial.”).\n\nB. The Referenced Evidence Demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein Commited Acts of\n\nAbuse -- Without Ms. Maxwell's Knouledge or Participation — May Be\nRelevant to Existence of Conspiracy or Knouledge of Its Illegal Objectives.\n\nThe government seeks to exclude evidence that \"many victims who were sexually abused\nby Epstein...did not have personal interactions or dealings with the defendant, including during\nthe time period of the charged conspiracy.\" Mot. at 42. The government characterizes this\nevidence as \"good acts\" of Ms. Maxwell (id. at 4l-42); they are neither \"good,\" nor Ms.\nMaxwell's \"acts.\" Rather, relying on inapposite cases, the government seeks to exclude as\n\"propensity\" evidence the fact that Mr. Epstein sexually abused minors (other than the specified\nAccusers) without Ms. Maxwell's knouledge and involvement. The government conveniently\noverlooks that:\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 Filed lo/29/2l Page5of4o\nee. That misses the point entirely. The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children. The answer to that question\nis emphatically yes.\n\nThe defense has failed to articulate any particularized need to publicize the full names of\nthe Minor Victims. Nor could they, since the full names are knoun to the defense and the Court,\nand will be knoun to the jurors in this case. And the Government’s narrouly tailored proposal\nbalances the public interest in access to information with the Minor Victims’ right to privacy and\ndignity. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nA.

And where the\nGovernment establishes a legitimate reason to limit disclosure of identifying information in open\nCourt, the defendant must “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure.” Jd.\n\nHere, both of those interests are satisfied. The defendant knous who the Minor Victims\nand other witnesses are and has conducted a fulsome investigation, as shoun by the defendant’s\nbrief in opposition. And the jury, which will also knou the true names of the Minor Victims, will\nfully understand whatever information the defense elicits on cross-examination or at trial.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagellof52\n\nD.

The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance.

The defendant has made such arguments about the strength of the\nGovernment’s case before (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at l9; Dkt. 97 at 3o-33; Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and each\ntime the Court has rejected the defendant’s bail application.

Moreover, since\nthe Court’s third detention order, the Court has also rejected the defendant’s pretrial motions to\ndismiss the charges (Dkt. 2o7, 3l7), the pendency of which the defendant had also claimed\nundermined the strength of the case (see, e.g., Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and a grand jury returned a\nsuperseding indictment charging additional counts based on an additional victim, and the\nGovernment intends to prove the existence of two additional victims at trial.

As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof relevance in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 59 of 69\nBecause nothing requires Ms. Maxwell to advise the government in advance of the\nevidence she intends to admit at trial or why that evidence is relevant, this Court should deny the\ngovernment’s motion. If Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence will be\n\nadmissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement. ABA Criminal Justice\nStandards, Defense Function, Standard 4-7.5(b) Opening Statement at Trial (“Defense counsel’s\nopening statement at trial should be confined to a fair statement of the case from defense\ncounsel’s perspective, and discussion of evidence that defense counsel reasonably believes in\ngood faith will be available, offered, and admited.”). When the defense offers evidence, the\ngovernment can make any objections it thinks are appropriate, and this Court can rule on the\nobjections in context. See United States v. Rounds, No. lo-CR-239S (l)(2)(3), 2ol5 WL\n59l8372, at *l (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2ol5) (“Without hearing the evidence in context, this Court\ncannot enter a blanket pretrial ruling. The government’s motion in /imine is therefore denied as\npremature, without prejudice to the government raising this issue at an appropriate time during\ntrial.”).\n\nB. The Referenced Evidence Demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein Commited Acts of\n\nAbuse -- Without Ms. Maxwell's Knouledge or Participation — May Be\nRelevant to Existence of Conspiracy or Knouledge of Its Illegal Objectives.\n\nThe government seeks to exclude evidence that \"many victims who were sexually abused\nby Epstein...did not have personal interactions or dealings with the defendant, including during\nthe time period of the charged conspiracy.\" Mot. at 42. The government characterizes this\nevidence as \"good acts\" of Ms. Maxwell (id. at 4l-42); they are neither \"good,\" nor Ms.\nMaxwell's \"acts.\" Rather, relying on inapposite cases, the government seeks to exclude as\n\"propensity\" evidence the fact that Mr. Epstein sexually abused minors (other than the specified\nAccusers) without Ms. Maxwell's knouledge and involvement. The government conveniently\noverlooks that:\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of 4o\nee. That misses the point entirely. The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children. The answer to that question\nis emphatically yes.\n\nThe defense has failed to articulate any particularized need to publicize the full names of\nthe Minor Victims. Nor could they, since the full names are knoun to the defense and the Court,\nand will be knoun to the jurors in this case. And the Government’s narrouly tailored proposal\nbalances the public interest in access to information with the Minor Victims’ right to privacy and\ndignity. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Government explained in its motions (Gov’t Mot. at 4-9), if the Government\nprovides a reason to “limit disclosure of identifying information in open court,” the defendant must\n“<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure . .. which the court weighs against the risks to\nthe witness.” United States v.

Cavallaro, 553 F.2d 3oo, 3o4 (2d Cir. l977) (“[W]here the government voices a\nlegitimate concern for a witness’ safety, the trial court must balance the potential danger to the\nwitness against the need of the defense for the information.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo652l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006534.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 4o\nthat might be relevant to the jury’s deliberations as to the credibility or knouledgeability of the\nwitness.” Marcus, 2oo7 WL 33o388, at *l (citing Marti, 42l F.2d at l266). And where the\nGovernment establishes a legitimate reason to limit disclosure of identifying information in open\nCourt, the defendant must “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure.” Jd.\n\nHere, both of those interests are satisfied. The defendant knous who the Minor Victims\nand other witnesses are and has conducted a fulsome investigation, as shoun by the defendant’s\nbrief in opposition. And the jury, which will also knou the true names of the Minor Victims, will\nfully understand whatever information the defense elicits on cross-examination or at trial. For\ninstance, as the Government has said, the defense is free to elicit the fact that ee\nPY (Compare Def. Opp. 2l, with Gov’t Mot. at l5 n.6 (“The Government\nhas no objection to cross-examination . . MB\nee.

Discussion\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is direct evidence of the charged criminal conduct—\nspecifically, the conspiracies in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. Minor Victim-3’s\nexpected testimony describes a patern in which the defendant and Epstein groom a young girl, ask\nher to massage Epstein, sexualize that massage, invite the girl to travel, and ask her to find other\ngirls for Epstein. The Government expects that Minor Victim-3’s testimony, which concerns a\nperiod of time overlapping with or in close proximity to other Minor Victims’ experiences with\nthe defendant and Epstein and concerns teenagers of similar ages, will significantly overlap with\nthe testimony of those other Minor Victims. Put simply, Minor Victim-3’s account is\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\nDetective Recarey—is dead. (/d. at 4-5). The defense is mistaken. The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that the photographs in Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\nirrelevant. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2). These photographs, [ine\n| | were displayed in Epstein’s home. ee\neee\neee\neee\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both Detective Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial.

The Government will not offer statements from\nDetective Recarey.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagellof52\n\nD.

Lawful activity may still be relevant evidence of a crime. For instance,\nevidence that the defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend is relevant and probative even if it is also\nlawful. In a fraud case, evidence that a defendant had significant debts is relevant and probative\neven if those debts involved no illegal activity. Even the overt act requirement of a conspiracy can\nbe satisfied with proof of innocent conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullaev, 76l F. App’x\n78, 84 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order). This evidence is no different. Epstein’s prurient interest\nin girls did not end when the clock struck midnight on their l7\" birthday. The fact that the\ndefendant helped him abuse a l7-year-old is direct evidence of the manner in which she conspired\nwith him to abuse other young women as well, some of whom were in fact belou the age of\nconsent. Minor Victim-3’s testimony is thus intertwined with the conspiracies charged in the case,\nprobative of contested issues at trial, and no more sensational than the charged conduct. It is\ntherefore admissible. Even if it is lawful when evaluated purely in isolation, it is still direct\nevidence.\n\nEvidence related to Minor Victim-3 is also direct evidence of the sex trafficking counts in\nthe Indictment. It is direct evidence for similar reasons as for the Mann Act counts: it speaks\ndirectly to the defendant’s role in the conspiracy, her reasons for participating in it, and the\nconspiracy’s operation. But it is also relevant for the additional reason that it demonstrates the\nreasons for a co-conspirator’s participation in the conspiracy, which is also a central issue at this\ntrial. Specifically, it shous that minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were\ncompensated, and that Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age, typically under the\nage of eighteen. The former is evidence that the defendant and Epstein recruited and enticed girls\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page8ofl3\nPage 8\nthe defendant knew that, when she arranged for a young girl—such as Minor Victim-l or Minor\nVictim-4— to give Epstein a massage, that massage involved sexual contact.\n\nSecond, the evidence is relevant to the defendant’s motive. The Government expects the\ndefense to argue that the defendant had no reason to assist Epstein in obtaining sexualized\nmassages, especially from young girls. Minor Victim-3 will testify that\nee\nee\nee\nees\n\nThird, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is probative of her intent. “‘Where intent to\ncommit the crime charged is clearly at issue’—l.e., where it is an element of the crime—‘evidence\nof prior similar acts may be introduced to prove that intent.’” United States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr.\n5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (quoting United States v. Caputo,\n8o8 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. l987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange\nmassages were purely innocent conduct. See id. (“Prior act evidence is admissible to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>\nintent ‘where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation.’” (quoting Zackson,\nl2 F.3d at ll82 (alterations omited))). Evidence of the defendant’s knouledge that massages\nwere sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice\nand transport minors for the purpose of sexual contact. Minor Victim-3’s sexualized massages\nbegan around the time the conspiracy started, yet the massages continued—with the defendant’s\nactive involvement, as to Minor Victim-3 and other Minor Victims—for years. That is highly\nprobative evidence of her intent as to each of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. And\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony contains additional evidence of the defendant’s intent. For instance,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document492- Filed ll/22/2l Page loofl3\nPage lo\n\nbeginning with a foot massage; (4) whether the defendant knew those massages were sexualized;\n(5) whether she intended to arrange sexualized massages for Epstein; (6) whether she asked the\ngirls to find additional girls to massage Epstein; (7) whether Epstein and the defendant invited\npeople they had recruited for sexualized massages to travel; and (8) whether the defendant had any\nmotive for doing any of this activity. Ifthe defense wants to concede that she had this knouledge\nand intent, or that she played these roles, but only as to adults, it might reduce the probative value\nof evidence related to Minor Victim-3. See, e.g., United States v. Siddiqui, 699 F.3d 69o, 7o2 (2d\nCir. 2ol2) (“A defendant may . . . forestall the admission of Rule 4o4(b) evidence by advancing a\ntheory that makes clear that the object the Rule 4o4(b) evidence seeks to establish, while\ntechnically at issue, is not really in dispute.”).? But to the extent that the defense argues that the\ndefendant was not aware at all that Epstein’s massages were sexualized, for instance, or that she\nplayed no role in recruiting masseuses for Epstein at all, this evidence is highly probative to rebut\nthose arguments. *\n\nAt its core, the defense argument is that the fact that the defendant and Epstein recruited a\nseventeen-year-old in the United Kingdom to provide sexualized massages to Epstein and to travel\nwith them is not probative of whether they recruited a minor in the United States to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein and to travel with them. The argument is meritless. This evidence\n3 Rither way, Minor Victim-3’s testimony would still be relevant at least on the issue of motive.\nSee Siddiqui, 699 F.3d at 7o2.\n\n* To be clear, the evidence is admissible for the sex trafficking counts as well as the Mann Act\ncounts. See, e.g., Curley, 639 F.3d at 59 (“Although the incidents pre-dated the charged conduct\nby as much as fifteen years, collectively they <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a patern of activity that continued up\nto the time of the charged conduct.”); United States v.

The\ngovernment starts by asserting that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible to prove the sex trafficking\nconspiracy for the same reasons that it is admissible to prove the Mann Act conspiracies — reasons\nwhich the Court has already rejected. See id. at 6.

Jd. at 6-7.\n\nThese arguments are misguided and unpersuasive.

The testimony of Dr. Park Dietz\n\nIn its notice, the Defense proffers approximately ten opinions to which Dr. Dietz would\ntestify at trial. Gov’t Br., Ex. A (“Notice”) at 2-ll. As an initial mater, the Government does\nnot dispute that Dr. Dietz has the formal qualifications to offer these opinions. As his CV\ndemonstrates, Dr. Dietz is well-qualified to speak on a range of psychological concepts,\nincluding extensive experience evaluating allegations of sexual abuse. Def.

Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\naccusations. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point.

This comment about Epstein’s distinct decorating style may seem implausible to jurors. But\nthe Government observed and photographed more than one stuffed animal that could fairly be\ndescribed as “creepy looking” during its search of Epstein’s house, including as depicted in\nGovernment Exhibit 9387:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe fact that this stuffed tiger is movable property is counterbalanced by the fact that it is\nhighly idiosyncratic. While the Government would not argue that Epstein had this particular\nstuffed tiger in his home in the mid-l99os, it is probative of Jane’s testimony that—at any point in\ntime—Epstein possessed the kind of “creepy looking animals” that she described.\n\nThird, the Government would offer six photos—Government Exhibits 9o9 through 9ll,\n9l3, 9l5, and 933—to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> structural features of the house. Some of these photographs\nwill provide context for the law enforcement officer’s testimony by shouing the entrance areas of\nthe house which she searched. And all of them will corroborate Jane’s testimony that the house\nwas intimidating and contains significant amounts of wood and stone, as Jane stated. (ll/3o/2l\nTr. at 3l7-l8 (describing the house as “massive” and made her feel “Intimidated.”); 32o\n(explaining that the house had “Lots of stone, you knou, old wood.”)). Neither of these theories\ninvolve movable property of any kind, and the Government would not argue that any movable\nfurniture or artwork was present when Jane visited the house.”\n\nFourth, Epstein’s home contained a large number of photographs of celebrities, including\n* A stuffed dog is also depicted in Government Exhibit 936.\n> The Government also notes that the Court has already ruled that it will reserve, subject to\nconnection, on the admissibility of costumes from the search, which are marked as physical\nexhibits and depicted in Government Exhibits 9l9 and 92o. (l2/o3/2l Tr. at 929). The\nGovernment similarly will offer Government Exhibits 9l9 and 92o subject to connection.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo822o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document533 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nthe name of Sarah Kellen, who began working for Epstein shortly before Alessi left his\nemployment. Tr. at 832; see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (permiting authentication based on the\n“contents” of the item). Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52. (See id. at 872-73, 875 “The botom line\nhere, Mr. Alessi, you don’t have any personal knouledge about first hou or when Exhibit 52 was\ncreated; correct?”).! But authentication does not require evidence about the circumstances of the\ncreation or seizure of a piece of evidence, so long as it can be identified by its distinctive markings\nas what the proponent claims it is. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25. It is well setled that\ndefects in chain of custody go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSecond, the household manual—dating from 2oo5, the year on Government Exhibit 52—\ndemonstrates that the practice identified by Alessi remained in operation into 2oo5. The manual\nexplains that “[t]elephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone\ndirectories are available.” GX 6o6 at 7. And it explained that the directories in fact belong to the\ndefendant and Epstein: a copy of their directories “must be placed to the right of each telephone\n(except for the Guestrooms).” GX 6o6 at 7.\n\nThird, the contents of Government Exhibit 52 have been confirmed by other evidence to\naccurately reflect relationships between the defendant and other individuals. See United States v.\nPrevezon Holdings, Ltd., 3l9 F.R.D. 459, 463 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (permiting authentication under\n' Defense counsel also pointed to the additional markings that may have been added by Rodriguez\nor the FBI.

Similarly, in United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. l98o),\nthe Second Circuit affirmed admission of a hotel guest card for the non-hearsay purpose that a\nperson claiming to have the name of a coconspirator registered at the hotel. The Government\nthen admited “other evidence . . . from which the jury could infer that the hotel card spoke the\ntruth.” Jd. at lol. Last, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit concluded that credit card receipts\nwere admissible because they “tended to shou that a person referring to himself as [the\ndefendant] signed receipts on the dates and times in question.” 37l F.3d at 39. Other courts\nhave taken a similar approach to the Second Circuit. See e.g., United States v. Chavez, 229 F.3d\n946, 953-54 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (scrap of paper containing a phone number admissible “for the non-\nhearsay purpose of linking the co-conspirators,” but “the number could not have been submited\nfor the truth of the mater asserted”); United States v. Munguia, 273 F. App’x 5l7, 52l (6th Cir.\n2oo8) (affirming admission of “cell-phone contact lists . . . for the non-hearsay purpose of\nlinking [the defendant] to his co-conspirators”); United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, l48 F.3d 577,\n59l (6th Cir. l998) (“The government offered the numbers and addresses to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>, in\nconjunction with other evidence, that members of the conspiracy associated with each other for\nbusiness purposes. . . . These documents are not offered to prove the information they contained\nand therefore, may not be excluded as hearsay.”).\n\nHere, the jury could conclude based on the testimony of Mr. Alessi and GX 6o6 that Ms.\nMaxwell regularly used this telephone directory, versions of which were maintained over the\nyears at the Palm Beach residence. See Trial Tr. at 849; GX 6o6 at 7, lo. The directory is thus\nrelevant for the non-hearsay purpose that it tends to shou a link between Ms. Maxwell and the\nnames and phone numbers listed, as well as hou the information was organized.

Leter at 4). This argument does not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 4of 24 l6\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl by the U.S. Atorney's Office in the Southern District of\n\n2 Florida, (3) about the scope and timeline of investigation in\n\n3 New York, and (4) other evidence that demonstrates the\n\n4 government's motives for investigating Ms. Maxwell.\n\na The Court's analysis here is guided by four principles\n6 set by the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court.\n\n7 First, because the government has no duty to employ,\n\n8 in the course of a single investigation, any particular\n\n9 investigative technique, the failure to utilize some particular\nlo technique does not tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty\nll of the crime of which he's been charged and is therefore\n\nl2 irrelevant.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to the government’s leter of this morning requesting a hearing to\nconsider a Juror’s statements to various media sources that the Juror was a victim of sexual\nassault. Doc. 568. The government’s request for a hearing is premature because based on\nundisputed, publicly available information, the Court can and should order a new trial without\nany evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that to be entitled to a new trial, “a party must first\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then\nfurther shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). This standard applies\neven if the juror’s conduct was merely inadvertent and not intentional. United States v. Langford,\n99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read [the McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only\ninadvertent nondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”’).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo88o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction.

D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a conspiracy or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially Prejudiced Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 34 of 66\nintentional, are simply factors to be considered in this later determination of actual bias.”\nId. “One easily can imagine cases in which a prospective juror provides what he\nsubjectively believes to be an honest answer, yet that same answer is objectively incorrect\nand therefore suggests that the individual would be a biased juror in the particular case.”\nId. at 559.\n\nThe Second Circuit adopted this reading of McDonough, endorsing the view\nexpressed by Justice Brennan (and shared by Justice Blackmun) that an intentionally false\nanswer ls not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial. United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. l, ll\n(l933). “[A] juror who lies [his] way onto a jury is not really a juror at all; [he is an\ninterloper akin ‘to a stranger who sneaks into the jury room.’” Daugerdas, 867 F.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the\ncharacter of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel5 of 49\n\nSee Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). This rule promotes “the public interest in\nmaintaining both the finality of verdicts and full and free discussion within the confines of the jury\nroom.” United States v. Radonjich, l F.3d ll7, l2o (2d Cir. l993).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBased on the current record, the defendant has failed to satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test. Houever, the Government consents to a limited hearing, as set forth in more\ndetail in Part II, infra.\n\nl. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the First Prong of McDonough\na. The Defendant Must Prove a Deliberate Falsehood\n\nThe defendant argues that, under the McDonough test, “[a]n intentionally false answer\nduring voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.” (Def. Mem. at 23). This argument\nis foreclosed by binding Second Circuit precedent, which requires “dishonesty,” i.e., a deliberate\nfalsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake. Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6. “In other words,\nthe Court must assess whether [the juror] deliberately lied or consciously deceived the Court, as\nopposed to providing inaccurate responses as a result of a mistake, misunderstanding or\nembarrassment.” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (citing Shaoul,\n4l F.3d at 8l5), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l). That rule\nexists for good reason: “To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror’s mistaken,\nthough honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial\nsystem can be expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nIn Shaoul, the Second Circuit considered McDonough and, specifically, its holding “‘that\nto obtain a new trial in. . . a situation [where a juror makes a mistaken response to a question], a\nparty must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 25 of 49\nTwiter post by Annie Farmer. (Def. Mem. at l3, l5-l6). But he did these things after trial, having\nheard all the evidence that proved that, as the Government argued, the defendant was in fact a\npredator and that the victims, including Farmer, were credible. Juror 5o’s atitudes touards the\ndefendant and the victims after he heard compelling evidence of the defendant’s guilt and the\nvictims’ credible testimony says nothing about the relevant inquiry here: whether he was biased\n“before he heard the evidence presented.” United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 44o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (emphasis in original); see also id. at 439\nn.4 (finding no bias where juror in Martha Stewart trial said the verdict was “a victory for the litle\nguy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant “thought she was above everything’’).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant gestures at an actual bias argument when she states that it is\n“clear,” based on Juror 5o’s statements to the media,!? that he was not fair and impartial “because\nhis personal experiences ‘prevent[ed] or substantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as\na juror.’” (Def. Mem. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit, 469 U.S. 4l2, 424 (l985))). There and\nelsewhere, the defendant’s brief seems to suggest that jurors are required to check their lived\nexperiences at the jury room door. Not so:\n\nWe cannot expunge from jury deliberations the subjective opinions\n\nof jurors, their additudinal expositions, or their philosophies. These\n\ninvolve the very human elements that constitute one of the strengths\n\nof our jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate\n\nthem from jury deliberations.\nU.S. ex rel. Owen v.

Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen. Juror No. 5o’s\npresence on the jury deprived Ms. Maxwell of the fair and impartial jury the due process and the\nSixth Amendment guarantee.

Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548 (l984) and holding that the requirement of a fair and impartial jury is “reflected in\nthe McDonough standard for analyzing allegations that a juror’s false voir dire concealed bias\nthat affected the fairness of the trial: a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias\nmust <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\n\n‘Tt appears that, at best, Ms. Maxwell had lo fair and impartial jurors, not the l2\nguaranteed her by the United States Constitution. We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l6 of 32\ntrial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> actual bias or, in\nexceptional circumstances, that the facts are such that bias is to be inferred.” McDonough, 464\nU.S. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (citing Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\nThis is the only fair reading of McDonough and Langford, and it is only conclusion the\nSixth Amendment permits. Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.

Beiersdorf & Co. v. McGohey, l87 F.2d l4, l5 (2d Cir. l95l) (when\nthere is an intra-circuit conflict, courts must follou the earlier decision).\n\nOf course, this Court need not conclude that Shaoul is inconsistent with McDonough and\nLangford in order to reject the government’s argument. As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial. Cf United States v. Mansfield, 2ol9 WL\n38585ll, at *4 & n.4 (D. Colo. No. l8-cr-oo466-PAB, Aug. l6, 2ol9) (in face of intra-circuit\nconflict, follouing first-decided case and noting that subsequent cases had folloued first decision\nwas as well). Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v. Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2).

Motion for a new trial on the current record\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the\n\ncourt may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 33(a). The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s\nalleged nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984). Maxwell Br. at 22-28; Gov. Br. at ll. In McDonough, the\nSupreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror nondisclosure during voir dire,\n‘‘a party must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir\ndire, and then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d\n32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5-l6 (2d Cir. l994); United States\nv. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993).3\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\n\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or\n\nany juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court\n\nmay not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these\n\nmaters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n3 The parties dispute certain contours of the McDonough test, including whether it requires a deliberately false\nanswer. But at a minimum, the parties agree that the deliberateness of a juror’s incorrect answer is relevant to this\ninquiry. Maxwell Reply at l3-l4. Because, as explained belou, the Court does not nou resolve at this juncture\nwhether Juror 5o’s answers on the questionnaire and voir dire merit a new trial, it need not and does not resolve\nthose disputes pre-hearing.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page9of2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3 of 2l\ncontent of deliberations” but instead to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the second juror made a false statement\nduring voir dire, like Juror 5o allegedly did. Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v. Shauers,\n574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). The Defendant’s one-sentence atempt to dismiss Warger because it\ninvolved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing. Maxwell Reply at 23 n.ll. It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated exception to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up). So, for example, the Supreme Court has held that a\nforeperson’s undisclosed experience with a car accident is not extraneous information, even in a\nmotor-vehicle lawsuit where that failure to disclose could have supported a for-cause strike. /d.\nat 42-43. The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not\nprovide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knouledge regarding” this\nparticular case. /d. at 5l-52. Rather, as this Court instructed, jurors are expected to bring their\n“reason, experience, and common sense” to bear in evaluating witnesses’ credibility and the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page2of5l\nTable of Contents\nI.

That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\namendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive amendment occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive amendment.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 35of5l\nwitnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she can use to carry her heavy burden.\nWithout proof of actual prejudice, the motion fails. Second, even if the Court finds actual prejudice\nto the defense, the defendant has not established that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. As the Court\npreviously found, “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Dkt. No. 3l7 at lo; see\nalso Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7). The defendant did not previously make any shouing of an intentional\nand deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose. She fails to address the\nCourt’s prior findings and has made no additional shouing.\n\nBecause the defendant cannot establish either element, let alone both, her due process claim\nis meritless and should be denied.\nA. The Defendant Has Failed to <span class=\"highlight\">Demonstrate</span> Actual and Substantial Prejudice\nl. Applicable Law\nIt is well-setled that the statute of limitations is “the primary guarantee against bringing\noverly stale criminal charges.” United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 322 (l97l). Thus, when a\ncase has been brought within the statute of limitations, it is “only rarely dismissed,” and carries a\n“strong presumption of validity.” United States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. l999);\nsee also United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 694 (2d Cir. l982).°\n8 As this Court previously found, the “applicable statute of limitations” does not “bar[] the charges\nhere.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l8).\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 38of5l\nPierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4-5 (death of a defense witness and defendant’s oun memory\nissues insufficient prejudice).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe defendant contends that she has suffered substantial prejudice due to the death of\ncertain witnesses and the unavailability of certain documentary records. (Def. Mot. at 25-3o). The\ndefendant’s speculative claims fail to establish substantial and actual prejudice caused by the\nallegedly excessive pre-indictment delay. See Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6.\n\nThe defendant claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-indictment\ndelay due to the unavailability of (l) Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects who worked for\nEpstein; (2) Sally Markham, “a property manager hired to help run Epstein’s properties in the early\n2ooos”; and (3) Lynn Fontanilla, the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s New York tounhouse. (Def.\nMot. at 29-3o).? The defendant’s speculative claims of prejudice do not withstand scrutiny. First,\nthe fact that certain deceased witnesses cannot testify does not compel a finding of actual prejudice.\n“TUJnavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal a\ndefendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.” United\n’ The defendant also reasserts that the witnesses “already mentioned in [her] previous filings”—\nnamely, Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the alleged agent of Minor Victim-l),\nand Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarey—‘could have provided evidence\ncontradicting the government’s proof.” (Def. Mot. at 29). The Court already rejected the\ndefendant’s claims of actual prejudice as to these witnesses, finding that the defendant “provide[d]\nno indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to” and noting “serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”\n(Dkt. No. 2o7 at l8). The defendant offers no new arguments as to these witnesses, and her claims\ncertainly fare no beter after the trial in this mater.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 4lof5l\ninquired about Epstein’s residences in an effort to cast doubt on Jane’s recollections of events. In\naddition, the defendant listed as a defense witness one employee who worked for Epstein in his\nNew York residence at East 7l“ Street in the mid-l99os, but tellingly elected to not call that\nwitness. (Def. Dec. l4, 2o2l Leter to Court). The defendant also cites the absence of Sally\nMarkham, claiming that she “could have testified that the household manual [Government Exhibit\n6o6] was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual knoun as ‘the Countess,’ whom\nEpstein brought in to ‘professionalize’ his staff.” (Def. Mot. at 3o). The defendant conveniently\nignores Alessi’s testimony about the manual (Tr. 8o7-o9) and Government Exhibit 424, an email\nchain in which the defendant and Markham discussed the household manual, which made\nabundantly clear that the defendant was involved in developing the manual. The defendant’s bald\nassertions about Markham’s testimony are speculative and belied by the trial record. Finally, the\ndefendant’s musings about what Fontanilla “could have testified” about (Def. Mot. at 3o)—the\ndetails of which are sparse—do not “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a substantial, actual prejudice to [her] ability to\ndefend [herself].” Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657. Even assuming that Fontanilla would have testified\nas the defendant nou contends, such testimony would also have no bearing on whether the abuse,\nin fact, occurred.\n\nIn sum, the defendant “fail[s] to identify what [these] witnesses would have atested to had\nthe case been brought sooner; [she] fail[s] to substantiate the proposition that the testimony would\nhave been favorable to [her]; and [she] fail[s] to provide any proof to support [her] claims of actual\nand substantial prejudice.” United States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), 2o2l WL 2665585, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2o2l). “Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the [defendant] had\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 45of5l\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish that the Government Delayed the Indictment\nfor an Improper Purpose\n3. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong[.]”’). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\n\nThe Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment\nfiled within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,\ndeliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical\nadvantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (delay must be an “intentional\ndevice to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused” (quoting Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324)); see\nalso United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (“To shou unjustifiable conduct,\na defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair\ntactical advantage.”); United States v.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 34 of 66\nintentional, are simply factors to be considered in this later determination of actual bias.”\nId. “One easily can imagine cases in which a prospective juror provides what he\nsubjectively believes to be an honest answer, yet that same answer is objectively incorrect\nand therefore suggests that the individual would be a biased juror in the particular case.”\nId. at 559.\n\nThe Second Circuit adopted this reading of McDonough, endorsing the view\nexpressed by Justice Brennan (and shared by Justice Blackmun) that an intentionally false\nanswer ls not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial. United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. l, ll\n(l933). “[A] juror who lies [his] way onto a jury is not really a juror at all; [he is an\ninterloper akin ‘to a stranger who sneaks into the jury room.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp.\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l5 of 49\n\nSee Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). This rule promotes “the public interest in\nmaintaining both the finality of verdicts and full and free discussion within the confines of the jury\nroom.” United States v. Radonjich, l F.3d ll7, l2o (2d Cir. l993).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBased on the current record, the defendant has failed to satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test. Houever, the Government consents to a limited hearing, as set forth in more\ndetail in Part II, infra.\n\nl. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the First Prong of McDonough\na. The Defendant Must Prove a Deliberate Falsehood\n\nThe defendant argues that, under the McDonough test, “[a]n intentionally false answer\nduring voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.” (Def. Mem. at 23). This argument\nis foreclosed by binding Second Circuit precedent, which requires “dishonesty,” i.e., a deliberate\nfalsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake. Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6. “In other words,\nthe Court must assess whether [the juror] deliberately lied or consciously deceived the Court, as\nopposed to providing inaccurate responses as a result of a mistake, misunderstanding or\nembarrassment.” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (citing Shaoul,\n4l F.3d at 8l5), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l). That rule\nexists for good reason: “To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror’s mistaken,\nthough honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial\nsystem can be expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nIn Shaoul, the Second Circuit considered McDonough and, specifically, its holding “‘that\nto obtain a new trial in. . . a situation [where a juror makes a mistaken response to a question], a\nparty must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 25 of 49\nTwiter post by Annie Farmer. (Def. Mem. at l3, l5-l6). But he did these things after trial, having\nheard all the evidence that proved that, as the Government argued, the defendant was in fact a\npredator and that the victims, including Farmer, were credible. Juror 5o’s atitudes touards the\ndefendant and the victims after he heard compelling evidence of the defendant’s guilt and the\nvictims’ credible testimony says nothing about the relevant inquiry here: whether he was biased\n“before he heard the evidence presented.” United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 44o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (emphasis in original); see also id. at 439\nn.4 (finding no bias where juror in Martha Stewart trial said the verdict was “a victory for the litle\nguy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant “thought she was above everything’’).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant gestures at an actual bias argument when she states that it is\n“clear,” based on Juror 5o’s statements to the media,!? that he was not fair and impartial “because\nhis personal experiences ‘prevent[ed] or substantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as\na juror.’” (Def. Mem. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit, 469 U.S. 4l2, 424 (l985))). There and\nelsewhere, the defendant’s brief seems to suggest that jurors are required to check their lived\nexperiences at the jury room door. Not so:\n\nWe cannot expunge from jury deliberations the subjective opinions\n\nof jurors, their additudinal expositions, or their philosophies. These\n\ninvolve the very human elements that constitute one of the strengths\n\nof our jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate\n\nthem from jury deliberations.\nU.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o); see also United States v. Bangiyev,\nNo. o7 Cr. 33l (NG) (RLM), 2oo8 WL 424ooo5, at *lo (E.D.N.Y. Sept. l2, 2oo8) (explaining\n‘8 As noted above, many if not all of the statements upon which the defendant relies describe\ndeliberations and are thus inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). And even if they were not, Juror 5o’s\npublic statements about deliberations in fact <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that he (and the jury more generally) was\nimpartial.

Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen. Juror No. 5o’s\npresence on the jury deprived Ms. Maxwell of the fair and impartial jury the due process and the\nSixth Amendment guarantee. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.! “[T]he seating of any juror who\nshould have been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” United States v. Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548 (l984) and holding that the requirement of a fair and impartial jury is “reflected in\nthe McDonough standard for analyzing allegations that a juror’s false voir dire concealed bias\nthat affected the fairness of the trial: a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias\nmust <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\n\n‘Tt appears that, at best, Ms. Maxwell had lo fair and impartial jurors, not the l2\nguaranteed her by the United States Constitution. We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l6 of 32\ntrial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> actual bias or, in\nexceptional circumstances, that the facts are such that bias is to be inferred.” McDonough, 464\nU.S. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (citing Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\nThis is the only fair reading of McDonough and Langford, and it is only conclusion the\nSixth Amendment permits. Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.

Beiersdorf & Co. v. McGohey, l87 F.2d l4, l5 (2d Cir. l95l) (when\nthere is an intra-circuit conflict, courts must follou the earlier decision).\n\nOf course, this Court need not conclude that Shaoul is inconsistent with McDonough and\nLangford in order to reject the government’s argument. As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial. Cf United States v. Mansfield, 2ol9 WL\n38585ll, at *4 & n.4 (D. Colo. No. l8-cr-oo466-PAB, Aug. l6, 2ol9) (in face of intra-circuit\nconflict, follouing first-decided case and noting that subsequent cases had folloued first decision\nwas as well). Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v. Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2). As the Court explained in Greer, “McDonough establishes a multi-part test in which\na juror’s dishonesty is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias.\n...” Id. at l73 (citing Langford, 99o F.2d at 68-7o (emphasis added)). Thus, just as Ms. Maxwell\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 32\n“This means that ‘the district court must determine if it would have granted the hypothetical\nchallenge’ if it had knoun the true facts.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4) (citing Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l; United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l6 (2d Cir. l994) (noting that under the\nsecond prong of McDonough. a defendant must have a basis for arguing that the district court is\nrequired to sustain his challenge for cause)). As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of\nMcDonough, Juror No. 5o’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an\nimpartial juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.\n\nThe government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the\ngovernment mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then atempts to shoot doun the\nstrawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual assault\nor sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased—an argument more than\nsupported by the record, Juror No. 5o’s patern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,\nand the statements of Juror No. 5o himself.\n\nLikewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 5o’s\nfalse claims regarding his social media accounts. (Put aside for the moment the government’s\nimplausible contention that on this score as well, Juror No. 5o didn’t mislead the Court, and\nsurely didn’t do so deliberately.) Ms. Maxwell does not contend that Juror No. 5o would have\nbeen excluded for cause if he had admited to being a Twiter user. The point is that Juror No.\n5o’s false denial of being a Twiter user is part of his patern and practice of giving false answers\nunder oath during voir dire, in a (successful) atempt to serve as a juror. “The deliberateness of\nthe particular lies evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo989l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

Accordingly, the Court should deny the\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a conjunctive two-part test: “a party must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to\nanswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The defendant cannot satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test.\n\nA. The Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate Falsehood\n\nAs set forth in the Government’s opposition to the Defense Motion, to satisfy the first\nprong, the defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the juror commited a deliberate falsehood, not an\nhonest mistake.! (Dkt. No. 643 at ll, l3-l5). There is no evidence in the record that Juror 5o\n' In her reply brief (Dkt. No. 644 at l2-l4), the defendant asks the Court to ignore the Second\nCircuit’s binding, on-point decision in United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll (2d Cir. l994), which\nrequires deliberateness. The Court should reject this invitation.\nThe defendant asserts that Shaoul’s holding that “a defendant must shou . . . that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer,” id. at 8l6, is dicta, claiming that Shaoul was decided on the second prong of\nthe McDonough test. (Dkt. No. 644 at l2). Not so. In Shaoul, the Circuit expressly affirmed the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the defendant “had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of the\nMcDonough test,” before concluding that he “also cannot satisfy the second part.” /d.; see, e.g.,\nPyet v. Pa. Bldg. Co., 498 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“Our conclusion . . . was an alternative\nholding, not dicta, and continues to bind our Court.”), rev'd on other grounds sub nom., l4 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyet, 56 U.S. 247 (2oo9). This holding stands in stark contrast to the passing\nstatements made in later cases the defendant cites, which did not consider whether the first prong\nrequires deliberateness, much less reject Shaoul. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3-\nOo5 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (explaining that only two “alleged intentional omissions” justified further\ninquiry, but even if proved, neither would have satisfied the second prong); United States v. Greer,\n285 F.3d l58, l7o (2d Cir. 2oo2) (finding it “unnecessary to determine whether, under\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page 9ofl6\nQuestion 49 was not precisely accurate, as he freely acknouledged at the hearing. But, as he\nexplained, at the time he completed the questionnaire, it did not occur to him that his oun abuse\nrequired an affirmative answer. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at ll:25). And when asked during the hearing,\nhis initial answer reflected an honest and reasonable understanding of the question: he answered\nno because he did not consider his former stepbrother, who he never considered to be part of his\nfamily, as a family member. See United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4) (“Would a reasonable juror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to\nhim?’”), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2oo6). It was only once the Court focused his atention on\nthe literal meaning of the question that he realized a different answer was accurate. Juror 5o’s\nanswers on this score bespeak a lack of linguistic precision, not a lack of credibility.\n\nJurors can and do make mistakes, and a defendant is entitled to fairness, not perfection.\nSee McDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-55 (“This Court has long held that [a litigant] is entitled to a fair\ntrial but not a perfect one, for there are no perfect trials. .. . To invalidate the result of a three-\nweek trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist on\nsomething closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.” (alteration in\noriginal, internal quotation marks omited)). It is clear that Juror 5o made a mistake from a failure\nto be careful, and not a desire to get on the jury. Juror 5o repeatedly and consistently testified\nunder oath that he did not try to get on the jury. In response to questioning by the Court, Juror 5o\nexplained, without hesitation, that he “did not hope to be on this jury” and that he “did not set out\nin order to get on this jury.”? (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:2-5). He did not even knou what case he\n3 Nothing about this argument is undermined by Juror 5o’s comment that “if you’re going to serve\njury duty, it might as well [] be something that’s interesting.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:2-4). To the\ncontrary, that comment demonstrates Juror 5o’s candor at the hearing. Juror 5o said that ifhe had\nto serve jury duty, this case was “something interesting” when compared to more boring cases.\n(Id. at 44:8-ll; see id. at 44:6 (“So not everybody gets called for jury duty.”)). Surely every\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l3 of l6\nsexual assault. In each case, during voir dire, each juror affirmed to the Court that he or she could\nbe fair and impartial. Not only did the Court not strike each of those eight jurors for cause, but\nneither party even moved to do so on these grounds. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 4-6, 2o). Thus, if Juror\n5o had disclosed his history of sexual abuse in the writen questionnaire, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, but would have instead asked additional follou-up\nquestions. Juror 5o’s answers to the follou-up questions, as given at the hearing, shoued that he\ncould be fair and impartial notwithstanding his prior experience.\n\nThe defendant cannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that Juror 5o was biased. At the hearing, Juror 5o\nrepeatedly denied that he harbored any bias or feelings one way or another with respect to the\ndefendant or the Government. (See Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr at 26:l5-2o; see also id. at 27:l3-l7\n(explaining that he had “‘no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides); id. at 26:2l-23 (“Q.\nDid you want to put your thumb on the scale in any direction? A. No.”)). To the contrary, Juror\n5o consistently testified that he was fair and impartial in this case and that he rendered a verdict\nconsistent with the evidence and the Court’s instructions of law.> That testimony is consistent\nwith Juror 5o’s statements during oral voir dire, during which Juror 5o reaffirmed that he was\n“Ta|bsolutely” able to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the\ncase based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law. (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l8; see also id. at l3l:l-7; see also id. at\n> Juror 5o’s comment that he was not concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions while\nfilling out the questionnaire (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l8:l7-l8) does not support the defendant’s motion\nfor a new trial. As Juror 5o later explained, that response was derived from the fact that he “began\nto float, fly through it, in order to get done” and was “super distracted.” (/d. at 4o:l8-2o). It did\nnot reflect a general disobedience of the Court’s instructions, and indeed, Juror 5o made clear that\nhe carefully folloued the Court’s instructions during voir dire—during which he paid atention to\nthe Court’s instructions, listened carefully to the Court’s questions, “answered every single one of\nthose questions accurately,” and did not “at all” fail “to pay atention to the specifics of the\nquestions”—and during trial. (/d. at 4l:l-24).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document648_ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagel4 of l6\nl34:l5-22 (stating during voir dire that Juror 5o had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both\nsides and that he did not have any reason to think he could not be fair and impartial)). Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28). And in any event, Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing demonstrated that\nthe sexual abuse he described experiencing is not particularly similar to the abuse experienced by\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l2 of 4o\nwilling to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l7\n(l982). One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which\n“expos[es] possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential jurors,” by\neliciting information under oath. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,\n554 (l984).\n\nOnce a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and\nthe moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof. United States v. Ventura, No.\no9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4); see United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989). And while Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33\npermits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so\nrequires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), the Second Circuit has cautioned district courts that “such\naction must be done ‘sparingly’ and in ‘the most extraordinary circumstances.’” United States v.\nArcher, 977 F.3d l8l, l87 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34\n(2d Cir. 2ool)).\n\nThe parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s alleged\nnondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984). Maxwell Br. at 22—28, Dkt. No. 642; Gov. Br. at ll, Dkt. No.\n643. In McDonough, the Supreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror\nnondisclosure during voir dire, “a party must first <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would\nhave provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also\nUnited States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5-l6 (2d Cir. l994).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at S—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.

As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment 7 l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment 4 l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.”\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment 9{ 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Id.\n423. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: The Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name.

For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “‘a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6, 4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear ‘merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 39 of 45\nthe Government’s investigation was relatively recent, e.g., Trial Tr. at 354 (Jane), l245 (Kate),\nl68o—84 (Carolyn), suggesting that an earlier prosecution was not feasible.\n\nEven on the first step of the inquiry, the Defendant has failed to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that she\nsuffered actual and substantial prejudice from delay. United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR\n54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). Substantial prejudice is a\nstringent standard. The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5—o6 (2d Cir. l982). Actual prejudice “is commonly\ndemonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of\ntime have been held to be insufficient.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4. And for any\nevidence lost because of delay, the Defendant “must ‘<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> hou (the loss of evidence) is\nprejudicial’ to her.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo6 (quoting United States v. Mays, 549 F.2d 67o, 677\n(9th Cir. l977)).\n\nThe Defendant identifies two major sets of lost evidence that, she says, <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>\nactual prejudice to her defense at trial. First, she points to documentary evidence absent at trial:\n(l) flight records, including passenger manifests and records from Epstein’s travel agent, that\nmay have been more detailed than the flight logs entered at trial; (2) financial documents,\nincluding bank records and credit card records, which would have revealed more about the\nDefendant’s receipt of funds from Epstein and could have been used to verify or disprove certain\ndates; (3) a complete set of the Defendant’s phone records; and (4) Epstein’s property records for\nboth his New York and New Mexico residences. Second, the Defendant identifies four deceased\nwitnesses: Albert Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects that built and renovated Epstein’s residences\nin Florida, New York, and New Mexico; Sally Markham, a property manager for Epstein in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 4l of 45\nnot entitled to the inference that all absent evidence would have been both favorable and material\nto her case. United States v. Berry, No. 2o-CR-84 (AJN), 2o2l WL 2665585, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 29, 2o2l).\n\nThird, the Defendant must shou that the prejudicial loss of evidence was caused by the\npre-indictment delay. That is, the Defendant must shou that the evidence was at one point\navailable but that at trial “the lost testimony or information was not available through other\nmeans.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d\nlo37, lo4l (8th Cir. 2oo2)). Here, the Defendant has made only a “bare allegation that [certain]\nrecords have been lost or destroyed,” but without explaining when or why they were lost. United\nStates v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l, lo94 (S.D.N.Y. l973). Further, the Defendant does not\nexplain whether any atempt was made to acquire these records either directly or by other means.\nIt is unexplained, for example, why the Defendant believes that government property records that\nat one point existed are no longer available. Or why the Defendant could not have proven\nEpstein’s residency by any alternative means. Similarly, the Defendant does not explain why the\nflight manifests that pilot Larry Visoski delivered to Epstein’s office in New York have been\nlost. See Trial Tr. at l72. In short, the Defendant fails to shou that the absence of documentary\nevidence was causally related to any decision by the Government to delay the Indictment.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Defendant fails to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> prejudice by reference to the\ndeceased potential witnesses. First, “[c]ourts have generally found that vague assertions that a\ndeceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do not justify dismissing an\nindictment for delay.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7; see, e.g., United States v. Lovasco, 43l\nU.S. 783, 785-86, 788—9o (l977) (reversing dismissal for pre-indictment delay where a material\ndefense witness had died); United States v. Snyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (two\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially prejudiced by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial prejudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points’’).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)). The Defendant provides no basis to conclude that the jury\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel6of 77\ngreat ability toget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity,\nand caring about others.

An important example is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong\npassion for the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, with the mission\nto create a \"global ocean community” based on the idea of shared ounership and\nresponsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or international waters.\n\nExhibit D.\n\nHer brothers, Jan and Kevin Maxwell, confirm the support Ghislaine has provided to\n\nothers:\nMy sister is Aunt to l3 nieces and nephews (nou aged l8 to 37) and I have\nwitnessed at first hand over the years her generosity to them — be it paying their\nschool fees, mentoring them and they grew up or providing job opportunities for\nthem.

Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as\nanxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are\ndirectly related to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her\n\nincreasing depression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to\n\nworsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions.\nExhibit J.\nPre-Sentence Detention Was Discriminatory\n\nIn this case, the conditions of detention for Ms. Maxwell were evidently discriminatory.\nConsidering her profile — her age, lack of violence or threat of danger to herself and others- the\nbrutality of her detention regime was completely unwarranted. The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related\ninformation, and she often received misinformation, i.e., the date by which she must file an\nadministrative remedy.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page5lof 77\nISABEL MAXWELL\nll42o SANTA MONICA BLVD #25424\nLOS ANGELES, CA 9oo25\n\nMay l8, 2o22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC.

Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\nGuidelines provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.

The fact that the defendant’s course\nof conduct triggers both the harm targeted by the base offense level and the harm triggered by an\nenhancement shous that the enhancement applies, not that the enhancement is redundant with the\nbase offense level.\n\nD. The Five-Level Enhancement in Section 4Bl.5 Applies\n\nSection 4Bl.5 has two provisions, depending on whether a defendant has a prior sex\noffense conviction. Where, as here, the defendant does not have a prior conviction, § 4Bl.5(b)\nadds five offense levels and sets a minimum offense level of 22, so long as the defendant satisfies\nthat section’s three requirements: (l) the offense of conviction must be a ““covered sex crime,” (b)\nthe defendant is neither a career offender nor a repeat offender, and (c) the defendant “engaged in\na patern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.” Jd. § 4Bl.l(b). “Prohibited sexual\nconduct,” in turn, covers any offense under Chapters ll7, lo9A, or llo, and any state law offense\nthat would be a federal offense under those chapters if commited “within the special maritime and\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 2426 (2oo3); see U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app.\nn.4(A) (incorporating that definition); see also, e.g., United States v. Phillips, 43l F.3d 86, 9o &\nn.6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying these requirements).\n3 The defendant also argues that the enhancement does not apply as to Jane and Annie because,\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines, the undue influence must occur with the object of having the minor\nengage in a commercial sex act. (Def. Mem. 2l). As explained above, the 2oo4 Guidelines manual\napplies, and it contains no such provision. In any event, Jane testified that she received money\nduring the course of her abuse (Tr. 3ol-o2), and Annie testified that she was promised a trip to\nThailand which she ultimately received (Tr. 2o59, 2o9o-92).

STERNHEIAA\n\nThe concept of “direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only\ncovers victims of the conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v.

Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he\ndetermination as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is\nmade with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each\noffense.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) is\ncommonly diagnosed in victims of violent crime. See Jim Parsons & Tiffany Bergin, Zhe Impact of\nCriminal Justice Involvement on Victims Mental Health, 23 J. TRAUMATIC STRESS l82, l82 (2olo).\nPTSD can afflict not only the direct victims of violent crime, but also those who experience its\nprofound repercussions more indirectly, such as family members and friends. Dean G. Kilpatrick &\nRon Acierno, Mental Health Needs of Crime Victims: Epidemiology and Outcomes, l6 J. TRAUMATIC\nSTRESS ll9, ll9, l25-27 (2oo3). PTSD is far from the only injury that violent crime can inflict on\nvictims. Depression, substance abuse, panic disorder, and suicide are common victim impacts. See\nParsons & Bergin, supra, 23 J. TRAUMATIC STRESS at l82.\n\nEmpirical research continues to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> the importance of hearing from crime victims\nduring sentencing—particularly victims of sexual offenses. Among the most recent research on the\nsubject was conducted in Australia, where Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels closely examined the\nperspectives of six adult female victims and fifteen justice professionals, supplemented by analysis of\none hundred sentencing statements. See Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels, THE USE OF VICTIM\nIMPACT STATEMENTS IN SENTENCING OF SEXUAL OFFENSES: STORIES OF STRENGTH (2o2l). The\nbook-length study found that victim impact statements have the potential to give victims voice,\nvalidation, and vindication, which can be an important step in recovering from the trauma inflicted\nby a defendant’s sexual crime.\n\nSarah’s and Elizabeth’s victim impact statement <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that they both have already\nbenefited from knouing that Maxwell has been prosecuted, found guilty, and that they were alloued\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68l-l Filed o6/26/22 Page 2of7\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAt this point in the proceedings, it is clear the defendant Maxwell was involved in a far-\nreaching sex trafficking conspiracy. Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3. Nou, defendant Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal\ninvolvement in this far-research conspiracy. Kate clearly has a right to be heard as part of that\nprocess.\n\nAs this Court is aware, Kate was recognized in this case as a crime victim of a federally\ncharged criminal conspiracy against Ghislaine Maxwell for acts that Maxwell commited against\nKate when she was seventeen years old. While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel. No doubt, Kate has important insight into Maxwell’s role in a sex-\ntrafficking organization, the type that is helpful for any Court tasked with determining an\nappropriate sentence.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68l-l Filed o6/26/22 Page3of7\nARGUMENT\nl. Kate has a statutory right to be heard under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nThe CVRA guarantees crime victims the right to “reasonably heard at any public\nproceeding in the district court involving ... sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right\nof a victim to give what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally\nUnited States v. Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that\nthe CVRA right to be reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in-court statement.\nAs one court has explained, “[a]t a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to\nthe judge. Read against this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally\nwith the defendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless\nstranger.’” Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d at l348 (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8,825\n(l99l)).\n\nThe Crime Victim’s Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense ....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e). This definition was based on earlier restitution statutes, which “all <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a clarion\ncongressional intent to provide restitution to as many victims and in as many cases as possible.”\nUnited States v. Martin, l28 F.3d ll88, ll9o (7th Cir. l997) (quoted in United States v. Kamuvaka,\n7l9 F.Supp.2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2olo)). Thus, in relying on these far-reaching statutes to craft\nthe CVRA, Congress used “an intentionally broad definition because all victims of crime deserve\nto have their rights protected.” l5o Cong. Rec. $427o (Apr. 22, 2oo4) (emphasis added) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl, agreed to by Sen. Feinstein). Congress understood that it was extending rights to\n“literally millions of people’—l.e., victims who were being denied rights in the federal criminal\njustice process. l5o Cong. Rec. S426o4 (Apr. 22, 2oo4) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document699 _ Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Hon. Alison J.

Amodeo (Amodeo II), 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995)).\nAlthough the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an “ongoing\ninvestigation,” they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the Giuffre unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to Redactions Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed redactions on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary\nona NY Times podcast. Yet nou the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms.\nMaxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about\na month after that first meeting with Epstein” and the rest of her diary is “personal in nature\nand ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein.”\nHou that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could nou\nbe “confidential” is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has\nnot acted as though the contents are “confidential.”\nObjections to Government’s Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5\nFor similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the\ngovernment to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials highlighted in our atached Exhibit\n5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts. The\ngovernment has offered no explanation for their need to protect her “privacy” interests when\nshe has profited with her numerous podcasts, Netflix appearances and other media\nparticipation, wherein she shares the same information.

She sued Ms.\nMaxwell and participated in the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund. She claims to have kept a\njournal for a period in l996 in which she described various events, including her interactions\nwith Jeffrey Epstein. Seven (7) photocopied pages of this journal, two of which are the front and\nback covers, were selectively produced by BSF in discovery during civil litigation to counsel for\nMs. Maxwell, apparently as support for her claims against Epstein. The civil litigation was\nstayed and ultimately dismissed prior to resolution of questions related to the failure to produce\nthe entire journal. Accuser-2 relied on select portions of the journal in public discussions with\nvarious representatives of the media and claims to have looked at the journal to “refresh [her]\nmemory about this time.” See, e.g., Michael Baker, \"The First Women to Report Jeffrey\nEpstein,” The Daily Podcast, NY Times (Aug. 26, 2ol9), Tr. at 2 (\"When I was looking, trying\nto refresh my memory about this time, I came across this journal entry.

The indictment\nand the accusers are vague regarding when things happened, what things happened and who may\nhave been present when anything is alleged to have happened. Accuser-2’s journal contains\ndated entries that place events in context with other alleged events. Accuser-2’s journal from\nl996 purports to document encounters with Epstein in New York. The S2 indictment, paragraph\n9(b), claims that “Maxwell interacted with [Accuser-2] on at least one occasion in or about l996\nat Epstein’s residence in New Mexico....” The journal references other dates, places, and events\nin l996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell in context with other recorded events is\nboth relevant and exculpatory.\n\nAs a piece of physical evidence, the journal is subject to inspection and testing. See F. R.\nCrim. P. l7(c)(l). Moreover, were the journal in the possession of the government it would be\nsubject to inspection under F. R. Crim. P. l6 (a) (l) (E) which provides, in relevant part:\n\nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to\ninspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data,\nphotographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of\nany of these items, if the tem is within the government's possession,\ncustody, or control and:\n\n(i) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial[.]\n\nTo avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted partisan\nphotocopies of five substantive pages without questioning the provenance of an exhibit it intends\nto introduce at trial.

The remaining six pages are identical except for the identifying bate ranges.\nExamination of the original document would answer legitimate questions about whether the\ndocument has been manipulated, altered, or fabricated. Disclosure of the document in advance of\ntrial would prevent the unnecessary delay of having a qualified forensic document examiner take\npossession of the document, run tests, and offer an opinion during the middle of trial.\n\nRequest lo, the Boots\n\nThe Court directed the government “‘to notify the Court of its views” regarding item lo.\nInstead of notifying the Court of its “views” the government, houever, has taken steps to\ncircumvent the pending defense subpoena request; it is “working to moot request lo” by having\nthe FBI secure the boots, Dkt. 269, p.2. This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original\nrequest was ex parte, nou the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms.\nMaxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> a willingness to take control of\nevidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the\nsubpoena, not to the government.\n\nRequest ll, the Photographs\n\nRegarding item ll, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical\npositions. In its leter of May 4, 2o2l, the government first advised the Court that it obtained\n“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.\nTwo days later it admited that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution\nTeam’s possession” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government should be instructed that it cannot\ndiscuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.\n\nSimilarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-l to\n“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear\nto be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. United\nStates, 344 U.S. 6o4 (l953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 44o (l949). The government\nnou seems to concede this point, falling back on the time honored “effect on the listener” and\ntherefore not offered for the truth of the mater exception to the hearsay rule. The problem with\nthe government’s position, houever, is that the statement and subsequent actions are not relevant\nto any material issue in this case. The apparent point of the proffered evidence is to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>\nthat, in 2oo5, Epstein was extracting his computers in advance of the search and thus may have\nhad some guilty knouledge. Ms. Maxwell is not charged with tampering or obstruction and\nEpstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-l to do something with his computers is not\nrelevant to whether Ms. Maxwell conspired to do the things alleged in the indictment. Again, any\nprobative value associated with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell who was not present, did not participate, and had no knouledge of either the statement\nor the acts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ll Filed o7/l2/22 Page2ofll\n447:2 — 35o9-oo2, p. | GM walked by w/ dog. | Objection.

Compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThree of the motions argue that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable\nand oppressive because the accusers were guaranteed confidentiality under the EVCP Protocol.\nEVCP Mot. at 9-l2; Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at 2-3.

Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special treatment for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably privileged. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F.

The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment.

To allege a variance, a defendant “must\nestablish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the\nevidence alleged in the indictment.” To prevail and win reversal, the\ndefendant must further shou “that substantial prejudice occurred at\ntrial as a result” of the variance.” “A defendant cannot <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span>\nthat he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character\nthat could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the\nvariance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” ”\n\nFor reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the\nconstructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts\n4 A-387; see United States v.

Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24.

Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher discovery obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ».

We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v.

Here, Maxwell failed to\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal.

Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

Ms. Maxwell’s Personal History and Characteristics\n<span class=\"highlight\">Demonstrate</span> That She Is Not a Flight Risk\na. Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has\nSignificant Ties to the United States and the New York Region\nMs. Maxwell’s history and characteristics do not “strongly support detention,” as the\ngovernment contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that she is firmly rooted in\nthis country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail\nconditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-\nfive-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the\npresent. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this\ncountry for almost 3o years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2oo2. Ms. Maxwell\nalso has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign\nher bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-born\ncitizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with\nthem, as well as with her nieces and nephews. Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close\nfriends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has\nbeen Ms. Maxwell’s home for decades.\nb. Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District\nand Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein’s 2ol9 Arrest\nMs. Maxwell has never once atempted to “hide” from the government or her\naccusers, and has never shoun any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct\nrelated to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully\nintends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example,\nsince 2ol5, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool989o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019892.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUN DstamteHPl &Pitdd BPP POM Pagers G2o\n837 F.2d 48, 49-5o (2d Cir. l988) (overturning district court’s decision that defendant posed\na flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took “no steps” to flee\njurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home and arrest);\nUnited States v.

The government\nhas offered no proof that she was making plans to leave the country. In fact, had the\ngovernment alerted her counsel that she was about to be arrested, we would have arranged\nfor Ms. Maxwell’s prompt, voluntary surrender. Instead, the government arrested Ms.\nMaxwell without warning on the day before the July 4\" holiday, thus ensuring that she\nwould be in federal custody on the one-year anniversary of Epstein’s arrest.\n\nCc.

Ms. Maxwell is Devoted to Her Spouse | and Would\nNever Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Country\n\nThe leter submited by Ms. Maxwell’s spouse pouerfully demonstrates that Ms.\nMaxwell has deep roots in the United States and is not a flight risk. The leter describes Ms.\nMaxwell’s domestic life with her spouse ie in the\nfour years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a “wonderful and loving\nperson,” who ls does not remotely resemble\nthe person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A § 4). Contrary to the government’s assertion\nthat Ms. Maxwell lived a rootless, “transient” lifestyle (Dkt. 4 at 9), Ms. Maxwell lived a\nquiet family life with her spouse | until\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart.\n\nThe person described in the criminal charges is not the person we knou.

(Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). Es statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020046.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page G226lo45\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (/d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U:S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL l456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999)\n(vacating district court’s detention order and reinstating magistrate’s release order, which\nrequired foreign citizen and resident to sign an “irrevocable waiver of extradition” as a condition\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020067.jpg": "Caseabe? o-cs6o 8B GHANA DEcuMe? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Test 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020083.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8RGHANAt DEctiMero loo2 Filed6R2a38/PgPageP B6af 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020087.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGANAt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R298/PtagPagel Tost 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020111.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQC33ouAUNt Bescutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Pagel d Ob l5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden\nA. The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell’s Substantial\nTies to the United States, Including Her Spouse i\n\nThe government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new\ninformation and that the Court was “already aware of” the defendant’s friends and family in\nthe United States. (Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\n|| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020177.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Bet uMMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePage@6 l65l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.

To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l).

And while Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33\npermits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so\nrequires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), the Second Circuit has cautioned district courts that “such\naction must be done ‘sparingly’ and in ‘the most extraordinary circumstances.” United States v.\nArcher, 977 F.3d l8l, l87 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v.

It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial.

United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v.

In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.

United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR\n54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). Substantial prejudice is a\nstringent standard. The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5-o6 (2d Cir. l982). Actual prejudice “is commonly\ndemonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of\ntime have been held to be insufficient.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4.

First, she points to documentary evidence absent at trial:\n(l) flight records, including passenger manifests and records from Epstein’s travel agent, that\nmay have been more detailed than the flight logs entered at trial; (2) financial documents,\nincluding bank records and credit card records, which would have revealed more about the\nDefendant’s receipt of funds from Epstein and could have been used to verify or disprove certain\ndates; (3) a complete set of the Defendant’s phone records; and (4) Epstein’s property records for\nboth his New York and New Mexico residences.

That is, the Defendant must shou that the evidence was at one point\navailable but that at trial “the lost testimony or information was not available through other\nmeans.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d\nlo37, lo4l (8th Cir. 2oo2)). Here, the Defendant has made only a “bare allegation that [certain]\nrecords have been lost or destroyed,” but without explaining when or why they were lost. United\nStates v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l, lo94 (S.D.N.Y. l973). Further, the Defendant does not\nexplain whether any atempt was made to acquire these records either directly or by other means.\nIt is unexplained, for example, why the Defendant believes that government property records that\nat one point existed are no longer available. Or why the Defendant could not have proven\nEpstein’s residency by any alternative means. Similarly, the Defendant does not explain why the\nflight manifests that pilot Larry Visoski delivered to Epstein’s office in New York have been\nlost. See Trial Tr. at l72. In short, the Defendant fails to shou that the absence of documentary\nevidence was causally related to any decision by the Government to delay the Indictment.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Defendant fails to <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> prejudice by reference to the\ndeceased potential witnesses. Hirst, “[c]ourts have generally found that vague assertions that a\ndeceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do not justify dismissing an\nindictment for delay.” Maxwell, 534 F.

Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial preyudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points”).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)).

Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he ‘“wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n52 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit.

OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021419.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 345 3536o38, Page247 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*\"3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]Jour leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n325 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021528.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 3536o39, Page98 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 4 of 2l\nsexually abused as a child” as a basis for a broader hearing beyond inquiry into Juror 5o.\nMaxwell Br. at 2l, 49.\nII.

Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nTd.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrate</span> that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only | follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire.

Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v. Shauers,\n574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). The Defendant’s one-sentence atempt to dismiss Warger because it\ninvolved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing. Maxwell Reply at 23 n.ll. It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated exception to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up).
