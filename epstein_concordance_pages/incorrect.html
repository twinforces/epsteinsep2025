It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9.

Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000341.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l3 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000642.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 4 of 86 4\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl relatively straightforward.

(Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of i” (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001158.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect 6 Gb 36\nFrench law, is simply <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001175.jpg": "CaSedeZot er-OoF3ocAdNt n DEGmeholooo 2File@ 4258/26 a Ragec8 3 Ob 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001258.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€rOd33ouAdNt DibCutentl l7o2 lFiKGS3i8/2agPRidgect 66l8\ninstead guided by concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a\ndistrict court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case\ninvolved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request.

Ina leter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2o2l, the Head of the International\nCriminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaegle,\nasserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is\nalleged to have commited does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals,\nas nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the\ntime of the extradition request.\n\n5.

Because plain vanilla surrenders lack\nthe fanfare and atendant media coverage afforded to secret, armed, raids at dawn, the\nGovernment chose to invade Ms. Maxwell’s New Hampshire residence, arrest her, and stage a\nmedia presentation that included numerous statements that prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\nfair trial.\n\nImmediately follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, Acting U.S. Atorney Audrey Strauss held\na press conference in which she commented on Ms. Maxwell’s credibility and her <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>\nopinions concerning “guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the\ncase” in violation of Local Rule 23.l(d)(l), (4) and (7):\n\nPer the New York Law Journal:\n\n‘Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,’ Strauss said\n\nat a press conference announcing the charges. ‘Maxwell enticed minor girls, got\n\nthem to trust her and then delivered them into the trap that that she and Epstein\n\nhad set for them. She pretended to be a woman they could trust, all the while she\n\nwas seting them up to be sexually abused by Epstein and, in some cases, by\n\nMaxwell herself.’!\n\nAs reported in the Washington Post,\n\nStrauss, the acting U.S. atorney in Manhatan, said the socialite told that lie and\n\nothers in deposition because the truth ‘was almost unspeakable.’\n\nActing U.S. Atorney Audrey Strauss called the sex abuse described in the\n\nMaxwell case ‘the prequel’ to the charges they lodged against Epstein....\n\nMaxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend, and groom\n\nminor victims for abuse’ ... ‘In some cases Maxwell participated in the abuse\n\nitself.’\n\n! htps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2o2o/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-in-\nconnection-with-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-ring/?slreturn=2o2oo6l4l2492l\n\n* htps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-\nepstein/2o2o/o7/o2/2oc745o2-bc69-l lea-8cf5-9clb8d7f84c6_story.html\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\nrape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\n<span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\nrecognized that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 3\nB. Discussion\nl. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 5\ncame from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nits outside vendor to image, stamp, and dounload that electronic discovery, which the Government\nfinished preparing for production last week, from an electronic database. The volume of that\nproduction is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that\nthe vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the\nGovernment has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2o2o deadline, and the vendor\nis making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next\nweek and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional\ntime beyond November 9 to finalize this production. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the\nGovernment has made numerous productions consistent with the discovery schedule in this case\nand is working diligently to continue to meet the discovery deadlines in this case.\n\nWith respect to the defense’s other claims and accusations, the Government is prepared to\nrespond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s accusations about\nthe Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, but\nalso include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to\nreach agreement with the Government “[f]ollouing the close of discovery,” which has not yet\noccurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2o2o, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless\natempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule l6 discovery, or on a faulty\ndefinition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. l3, 2o2o,\nDtk. No. 4l, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of production of witness list until shortly before\ntrial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule l6 does not require\nproduction of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65, at l-2\n(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a\ndefendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the\nGovernment)).”\n\nWith respect to the Government’s October 7 leter regarding other agency files, the\ndefense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who\nit believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the\nGovernment has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more\nGovernment may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,\nthe Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.\n\n? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense nou contends that evidence\nabout the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Atorney’s Office\nfor the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense\nmakes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that\nagreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged\nin this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense\nnevertheless believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those\narguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.\n\n> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding\nany concerns about the Government’s October 7 leter or the Government’s planned productions\nprior to filing the Defense Leter with the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3l of 45\nIndeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of f | (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l6 of 36\nFrench law, is simply <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002194.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 33 of 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends.

Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.

According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o bill—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256.

Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely conspiracy count does not\nrender that count untimely.

The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll7 of 239\n\nThe defendant repeatedly argues that the Government’s failure to mention AUSA-l’s prior\ncontact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6 was a misrepresentation that led to the modification of the\nprotective order. The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\n<span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. As an initial mater, the Government did not insist, contrary to Maxwell’s twisted\nreading of the transcript, that “there had been no contact whatsoever” between Boies Schiller and\nthe Government at any time prior to the Government opening its investigation. (Def. Mot. 3 at l).\nInstead, Chief Judge McMahon’s question was more specific: referencing Chemical Bank and the\ndesire to avoid “a Chemical Bank kind of situation,” Chief Judge McMahon asked about contacts\nbetween the two parties “prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation.”\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added); see also Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (omiting the italicized portion\nof the question)). In response, the Government described accurately its communications with\nBoies Schiller that had occurred in the time period surrounding the opening of its investigation and\nthe issuance of the subpoena. Additionally, and in light of the Government’s prior arguments to\nChief Judge McMahon relating to Chemical Bank,*® the Government atempted to address the\nmisconduct at issue in that case: namely the production of confidential documents without seeking\nmodification of a protective order by confirming that, here, no such production had yet occurred.\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2) (noting that Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there\n* See, e.g., Exs. 8 & 9 at 2-3 (discussing Chemical Bank as rejecting a contempt request where a\nparty “compl[ied] with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order” and\nfocusing arguments on the nature of the production of documents); (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l5) (the\nGovernment describing Chemical Bank as “essentially say[ing]: You should have asked, but of\ncourse this is fine for you to disclose this information to the government based on the validly issued\ngrand jury subpoena”); cf.

As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government\nhad “either litle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there\nare [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l7). In support of her argument, Maxwell\ncites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David\nBoies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2ol6, asking ‘if the\nSouthern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the\nGovernment has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-l does not\nrecall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-l\ndoes not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury\n(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2ol6 meeting refer to the existence of depositions\ngenerally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general\nunderstanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at\n2l). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knouledge of the\ncontents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon were <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>.\n\nIn sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief\nJudge McMahon, and as such, the good faith exception applies. To the contrary, the record before\nthe Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nquestion and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in\nconnection with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knouledge of the contents of that file,\nand the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the protective order.\nUpon receiving a court order issued by a Chief United States District Judge who had carefully\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 239\nstatements at the heart of that case and the evidence that might have been uncovered had the\ndefendant answered the questions truthfully.

First,\nthe questions were aimed at developing a record in the civil suit that Epstein and the defendant\nrecruited Giuffre to Epstein’s Palm Beach property in the guise of hiring her as a masseuse, and\nthen sexualized that massage. Honest answers to those questions—for instance that Epstein in fact\nhad a scheme to recruit underaged girls for sexual massages—would have been corroborative of\nsome of Giuffre’s claims. Second, had the defendant honestly answered the deposition questions,\nGiuffre could have located other victims or witnesses who may have corroborated her testimony.\nBut in any event, the question of materiality should be put to the jury and is inappropriate for the\nCourt to resolve on a motion to dismiss without the benefit of the full factual record.

Yet Judge Preska’s opinion as to the propriety of certain redactions in a civil\ncase is not controlling as to whether the Government can meet the elements of a criminal perjury\ncharge here. First, before Judge Preska were the defendant’s denials of various sexual activities,\nnot honest answers that would have been quite different. In part for that reason, Judge Sweet\nauthorized the deposition at the outset. Second, the Government was not a party to the civil\nunsealing litigation and did not have an opportunity to be heard on this issue before Judge Preska.\n>!

Under Judge Sweet’s pre-deposition order,\nGiuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2ol6 deposition.\nGiuffre’s failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet’s order, is compelling evidence\nthat Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when\ndeposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an\nevidentiary hearing is appropriate.\n\nThe government’s second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth Amendment right.\nResp. at loo. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knouingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745\nF.3d l5, 23 (2d Cir. 2ol4).

Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four\nindividuals, “any employee” of one of Epstein’s companies, and “any unnamed co-conspirators\nfor any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR Report at l66\nn.237.

The government’s oun\nfile demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2oo6 (Opp. l6 n.9; Dkt. l48, Ex. B\n(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2’s claims regarding Ms. Maxwell nou\nincluded in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as\none of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2oo6 as part of the\ninvestigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.\nMaxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.\n\nAs a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status\nto enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9),\nfor the proposition that “plea agreements differ from commercial contracts” (Opp. l8), the\n“differ[ence]” to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement,\n* Accuser-2 is identified in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?!

Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase.

As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call fora\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULB.C, § 3299,\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Tn]Jotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl4\n\ne Ms. Maxwell moved residences and switched her primary phone\nnumber (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress. !\n\ne At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell allegedly ignored the\ndirection of FBI agents to open the front door of her residence and\ninstead moved into an interior room of the house.”\n\ne During a security sweep of the house, FBI agents found a cell phone\nwrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.?\n\nMs. Maxwell thoroughly rebuted each of these points in her second bail motion.

Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'?

And Minor Victim-\n3’s status as a “victim” under the foregoing provisions of law certainly does not affect the\nadmissibility of her testimony under Rule 4o4(b), which permits the admission of other act\ntestimony that almost by definition does not satisfy the elements of the charged crime.

The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (<span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law.

While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel6 of 49\n\nand then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Jd. at 8l5 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct disclosure would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “<span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United\nStates, 43o U.S. l88, l93 (l977) (determining court’s holding by reference to concurring opinions\nonly “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices”). And to the extent those concurrences may be considered in construing\nthe holding of McDonough, they were clearly available to the Second Circuit when it did so in\n8 While the vote count is not always clearly listed on Westlaw or other legal research sites, the\nofficial version in the U.S. Reports indicates as much.

Crim. P. 33(a). The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s\nalleged nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984). Maxwell Br. at 22-28; Gov. Br. at ll. In McDonough, the\nSupreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror nondisclosure during voir dire,\n‘‘a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir\ndire, and then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d\n32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5-l6 (2d Cir. l994); United States\nv. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993).3\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\n\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or\n\nany juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court\n\nmay not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these\n\nmaters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n3 The parties dispute certain contours of the McDonough test, including whether it requires a deliberately false\nanswer. But at a minimum, the parties agree that the deliberateness of a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> answer is relevant to this\ninquiry. Maxwell Reply at l3-l4. Because, as explained belou, the Court does not nou resolve at this juncture\nwhether Juror 5o’s answers on the questionnaire and voir dire merit a new trial, it need not and does not resolve\nthose disputes pre-hearing.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of5l\n\nTwo. (Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no relevance.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its instruction directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “irrelevant,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. So, I think that’s why precisely\nwe sent them back to the charge.” (Tr. 3l54).\n\nThe defendant renews her arguments nou, urging that the jury note shous that “the jurors\nhad the mistaken impression that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 34 of 66\nintentional, are simply factors to be considered in this later determination of actual bias.”\nId. “One easily can imagine cases in which a prospective juror provides what he\nsubjectively believes to be an honest answer, yet that same answer is objectively <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>\nand therefore suggests that the individual would be a biased juror in the particular case.”\nId. at 559.\n\nThe Second Circuit adopted this reading of McDonough, endorsing the view\nexpressed by Justice Brennan (and shared by Justice Blackmun) that an intentionally false\nanswer ls not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial. United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. l, ll\n(l933). “[A] juror who lies [his] way onto a jury is not really a juror at all; [he is an\ninterloper akin ‘to a stranger who sneaks into the jury room.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp.\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l6 of 49\n\nand then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Jd. at 8l5 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct disclosure would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “<span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United\nStates, 43o U.S. l88, l93 (l977) (determining court’s holding by reference to concurring opinions\nonly “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices”). And to the extent those concurrences may be considered in construing\nthe holding of McDonough, they were clearly available to the Second Circuit when it did so in\n8 While the vote count is not always clearly listed on Westlaw or other legal research sites, the\nofficial version in the U.S. Reports indicates as much.

The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive amendment and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it concluded that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel6 of 24\nF.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous. The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,\nwhereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\nconsideration of it. That is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page5ofl6\nintended to mislead the Court while completing his jury questionnaire or during voir dire. Juror\n5o testified under oath that he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he\nhas] ever made in [his] life.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:23-24). On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen questionnaire, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2). The questionnaire\nand the process by which Juror 5o completed the questionnaire “must be viewed in context.”\nUnited States v. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2 (WKS), 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4).\nJuror 5o’s description of the process of completing the questionnaire on November 4, 2o2l\ncredibly explained hou he came to make unintentional mistakes on the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\nquestionnaire was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 of l6\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 48 was clear and consistent. He made a mistake. His\ntestimony did not evince any intent to deceive or mislead the Court when completing the\nquestionnaire. Rather, it was consistent with his statements in the Daily Mail interview, which\nwas when Juror 5o first learned that the questionnaire may have contained a question that asked\nabout his oun sexual abuse history. (/d. at l5:l9-22). And it was during the Daily Mail interview,\nwhen first confronted with the possibility of having made a mistake, that Juror 5o told the reporter\nthat he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire asking whether he had experienced\nsexual abuse, but he “‘was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.” (Dkt. No. 643, Ex.\nB at 8). Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing echoed his comments to the press when he\nlearned of his error. Juror 5o did not knou he “had made a huge mistake,” and upon learning this\ninformation during the interview, he was “embarrassed and sort of like shocked and didn’t knou\nthat was the full question.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 44:l9-45:3).\n\nJuror 5o’s sworn testimony about the mistakes he made when completing the\nquestionnaire—which related to the single topic of the sexual abuse he experienced as a nine-year-\nold—similarly made clear that he did not intend to inaccurately answer Questions 25 and 49.\nWhen the Court inquired at the hearing about Juror 5o’s answer to Question 25—which asked\nwhether he or any relatives or close friends had been a victim of a crime—Juror 5o explained that\n“TlJjooking back at [Question 25] nou,” his negative answer was <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. (/d. at 9:22). He\nexplained that he “wasn’t thinking of [his] sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime because [he]\nno longer associate[s] being a victim” and that he had been thinking of whether he had been\n“robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that” at the time he was completing the\nquestionnaire.

Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page lo of 4o\nlimited approach proposed by the Government. The Court also rejected many of the Defendant’s\nproposed lines of questions. The parties were also permited to propose follou-up questions at\nthe hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 5o’s responses. The Court accepted\nsome of these proposals and rejected others.\n\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate. He\nexplained that when he was nine and ten years old, he was abused on multiple occasions by a\nstepbrother, who he no longer considered part of the family, and one of the stepbrother’s friends.\nHearing Tr. at 8. He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school. His mother\ncalled the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought. /d. at 8-9. Although he first\ntestified that “no” was correct for Question 49 because he did not consider the stepbrother part of\nhis family, upon further questioning from the Court, he acknouledged that the correct answer\nwould have been “yes.” /d. at ll-l3. He similarly acknouledged that “yes (self)” would have\nbeen correct to Question 25; although at the time of the questionnaire, he understood the question\nto be asking about being “robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that.” /d. at 9-lo.\n\nJuror 5o testified that these <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> answers were an inadvertent mistake and that he had\nnot intentionally failed to disclose his personal history of sexual abuse. /d. at l4-l6, 22-23. He\nexplained that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “completely skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand the questions. /d. at l4-l5. It took several hours to start\nthe questionnaire after a long security line and technical issues with the Court’s instructional\nvideo. His mind was preoccupied with a recent romantic breakup and the commotion at the\nnearby check-out table. He saw other prospective jurors completing their questionnaires and\nrushed to finish. He explained that he was unconcerned with diligently completing the\nquestionnaire; he assumed due to the sheer “volume” of prospective jurors being screened that it\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. /d. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire ls frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6 of 29\nenhancements that were applied in the PSR, the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo3\nGuidelines would be roughly 75% Jess than the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4\nGuidelines: l68-2lo months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 under the 2oo3\nGuidelines versus 292-365 months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o under\nthe 2oo4 Guidelines.” The parties dispute, houever, whether the offense conduct ended before\nor after November l, 2oo4, and whether a court or a jury must make that finding. See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of conviction” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 Guidelines apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\nGuidelines in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which Guidelines book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that determination, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 Guidelines; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 Guidelines in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n? The five-point difference in the total offense level is driven by the base offense level. Under the 2oo3 Guidelines,\nthe applicable base offense level is l9. See USSG § 2Gl.l(a)(l) (2oo3). Under the 2oo4 Guidelines, the applicable\nbase offense level is 24. See USSG § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4).

The government in its papers makes the argument that\n\n6 the background commentary can't be relied upon as authoritative\n7 because it is not explanatory or interpretative of what the\n\n8 guideline is.

That first sentence or two which talks about hou\nll this guideline can only be applied to offenders who represent a\nl2 continuing danger to the community is interpretative of what\n\nl3 the guideline is. The title of the guideline is repeat and\n\nl4 dangerous sex offenders. That explanatory commentary explains\nl5 hou to interpret what dangerous means. It means someone who is\nl6 continuously dangerous to the community, not someone who's\n\nl7 never been accused of a crime in the l8 plus years since the\n\nl8 crime in this case, and has never been accused of re-offending.\nl9 So I don't agree with that point. This is authoritative\n2o guidance from the Sentencing Commission, and the Court should\n2l consider it as such. Thank you.\n22 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, do you want to respond?\n23 MS.

Watkins 667 F.3d at 265;\n2 United States v. Streb, 36 F.4th 782. That's and Eighth\n\n3 Circuit case from 2o22. Courts have repeatedly concluded that\n4 a minor can be the victim of undue influence even if the minor\niy initiates a sexual meeting.

I therefore overrule the\n\n7 defendant's objection.\n\n8 I next turn to the government's only objection to the\n9 PSR Guideline calculation. I do find that Virginia Roberts and\nlo Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were\n\nll trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the\nl2 charged period. The Guidelines require that each minor victim\nl3 be considered a separate count of conviction. 2Gl.l.(d)l.\n\nl4 Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this\n\nl5 provision only because they were not named in the indictment.\nl6 This is an <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> basis for excluding them from the\n\nl7 calculation.

Wernick,\n23 69l, F.3d lo8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (citing 2Gl.l comment note 4).

The proffer we have from the defense nou\n2o is that, at most, the defendant lived in a home nearby before\n2l she moved to the 44 Kinnerton Street home. So to the extent\n22 that that's true -- and again, it's contradicted by the\n23 defendant's under-oath deposition testimony -- it would have\n24 only marginal impeachment value.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

(Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of i” (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020076.jpg": "Caseab2o-cre6o BROAN DEctIMer? loo2 Filed6R2a38/?gPagetl Goof 36\nFrench law, is simply <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020093.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctiMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tagPageBR6af 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span> claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020176.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Filecsas2 372l9 ePageHlG5l8\ninstead guided by concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a\ndistrict court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case\ninvolved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request.

This memorandum was writen pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at\nthe French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as\ncounsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail\nproceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”),\nwhere Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in\nsexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from l994 to l997.\n\n2. Ina previous opinion, I have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute\nan extradition request against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the\nUSA and France, without violating any superior norm of French and international law.\n\n3. AsIunderstand the defendant’s French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court\nas a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to\nrenounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court\nso requires.\n\n4. Ina leter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2o2l, the Head of the International\nCriminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaegle,\nasserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is\nalleged to have commited does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals,\nas nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the\ntime of the extradition request.\n\n5. This report was writen to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the\nproposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an\nextradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national.\n\n6.

As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected.

As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULS.C. § 3299.\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct.

Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Injotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020853.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page27 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The parties were also permited to propose follou-up questions at\nthe hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 5o’s responses.

He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school. His mother\ncalled the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought. /d. at 8-9.

He explained that he was unconcerned with diligently completing the\nquestionnaire; he assumed due to the sheer “volume” of prospective jurors being screened that it\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o953\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020959.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel33 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDenough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o959\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020966.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. Jd. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire is frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was <span class=\"highlight\">incorrect</span>. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021435.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA959 3536o39, Paged of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.3°’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it.

Rather, sucha\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls.
