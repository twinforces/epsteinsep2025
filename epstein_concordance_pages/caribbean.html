BLOGS & STORIES\nBEAST Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\nby Conchita Sarnoff\nERO THIS SKIP THAT BAe ese ERC\n| Hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first\naccused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast’s\nConchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved\nhim from a long prison term. She reports:\n* Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an\nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.\n* Earlier versions of the U.S atorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have\nlanded Epstein in prison for 2o years.\n«Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former\nSoviet republics, including three l2-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.\n* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be\nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was\nconvicted of,\n* Epstein’s atorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered\nprivate investigators to follou and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n« Then-Atorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the\nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of\nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\nDuring Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\n<span class=\"highlight\">Caribbean</span> island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—l3 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was alloued out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has setled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $l million—an\namount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\nWith that, the knoun viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and\nmay weil follou Polanski into a luxurious exile.\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n, SIE-mAn- (o% 356.7934?\nhitp:/Avww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029043.tif": ". ~ Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire or Goes Free - The Daily Beast @ Page 2 of 4\n; But the question remains: Did Epstein'’s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew;\nformer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—aliou him to receive only a slap on the\nwrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 2o-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—toc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the <span class=\"highlight\">Caribbean</span>.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Caribbean</span>—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst. Visitors report a\nstufted poodle is on the piano. The house, said one visitor. is like what Hollywood might imagine when\nfoes to shou the supernch.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ...

But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating 2 plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\nEpstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzie and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah.” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdiy\n“He lives ina different environment,” says Sicgal. “He's of this world.
